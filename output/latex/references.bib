	abstract = {The economic evaluation of healthcare interventions requires an assessment of whether the improvement in health outcomes they offer exceeds the improvement in health that would have been possible if the additional resources required had, instead, been made available for other healthcare activities. Therefore, some assessment of these health opportunity costs is required if the best use is to be made of the resources available for healthcare. This paper provides a framework for generating country-specific estimates of cost per disability-adjusted life year ({DALY}) averted ‘thresholds’ that reflect health opportunity costs. We apply estimated elasticities on mortality, survival, morbidity and a generic measure of health, {DALYs}, that take account of measures of a country’s infrastructure and changes in donor funding to country-specific data on health expenditure, epidemiology and demographics to determine the likely {DALYs} averted from a 1\% change in expenditure on health. The resulting range of cost per {DALY} averted ‘threshold’ estimates for each country that represent likely health opportunity costs tend to fall below the range previously suggested by {WHO} of 1–3× gross domestic product ({GDP}) per capita. The 1–3× {GDP} range and many other previous and existing recommendations about which interventions are cost-effective are not based on an empirical assessment of the likely health opportunity costs, and as a consequence, the health effects of changes in health expenditure have tended to be underestimated, and there is a risk that interventions regarded as cost-effective reduce rather than improve health outcomes overall.},

	abstract = {Background: Evidence on costs and health benefits of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) for children in Asian countries is limited but growing. As a region with a considerably high burden of pneumococcal disease, it is prominent to have a comprehensive overview on the cost-effectiveness of implementing and adopting a {PCV} vaccination program. Methods: We conducted a systematic review from Pubmed and Embase to identify economic evaluation studies of {PCV} for children in Asian countries up to May 2020. Data extraction included specific characteristics of the study, input parameters, cost elements, cost-effectiveness results, and key drivers of uncertainty. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses ({PRISMA}) statement was followed for this systematic review. The reporting quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards ({CHEERS}) statement. Results: After the screening process on both the title and abstract and full text of 518 records, a total of 25 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and were included in the review. The majority of included studies demonstrates that {PCV} for children is cost-effective in most of the Asian region, and even cost-saving in some countries. Most of the included studies implemented cost utility analysis ({CUA}) using either quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs}) or disability-adjusted life years ({DALYs}). Overall, the main drivers affecting the cost effectiveness were vaccine price, burden regarding pneumonia-related parameters, and the inclusion of herd effects. Conclusion: The children pneumococcal vaccination program appears to be a cost-effective intervention in Asia, and even cost-saving in certain conditions. Vaccine price, pneumonia-related disease burden, and the inclusion of the herd effect are observed as important key drivers in estimating cost-effectiveness in this region. Incorporating {PCV} in vaccination programs in this region was found to be highly favorable.},

	abstract = {As a country with the high number of deaths due to pneumococcal disease, Indonesia has not yet included pneumococcal vaccination into the routine program. This study aimed to analyse the cost-effectiveness and the budget impact of pneumococcal vaccination in Indonesia by developing an age-structured cohort model. In a comparison with no vaccination, the use of two vaccines ({PCV}10 and {PCV}13) within two pricing scenarios ({UNICEF} and government contract price) was taken into account. To estimate the cost-effectiveness value, a 5-year time horizon was applied by extrapolating the outcome of the individual in the modelled cohort until 5 years of age with a 1-month analytical cycle. To estimate the affordability value, a 6-year period (2019-2024) was applied by considering the government's strategic plan on pneumococcal vaccination. In a comparison with no vaccination, the results showed that vaccination would reduce pneumococcal disease by 1,702,548 and 2,268,411 cases when using {PCV}10 and {PCV}13, respectively. Vaccination could potentially reduce the highest treatment cost from the payer perspective at 53.6 million and 71.4 million for {PCV}10 and {PCV}13, respectively. Applying the {UNICEF} price, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ({ICER}) from the healthcare perspective would be 218 and 162 per {QALY}-gained for {PCV}10 and {PCV}13, respectively. Applying the government contract price, the {ICER} would be 987 and 747 per {QALY}-gained for {PCV}10 and {PCV}13, respectively. The result confirmed that {PCV}13 was more cost-effective than {PCV}10 with both prices. In particular, introduction cost per child was estimated to be 0.91 and vaccination cost of {PCV}13 per child (3 doses) was estimated to be 16.61 and 59.54 with {UNICEF} and government contract prices, respectively. Implementation of nationwide vaccination would require approximately 73.3-75.0 million (13-14\% of routine immunization budget) and 257.4-\$263.5 million (45-50\% of routine immunization budget) with {UNICEF} and government contract prices, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that vaccine efficacy, mortality rate, and vaccine price were the most influential parameters affecting the {ICER}. In conclusion, pneumococcal vaccination would be a highly cost-effective intervention to be implemented in Indonesia. Yet, applying {PCV}13 with {UNICEF} price would give the best cost-effectiveness and affordability values on the routine immunization budget.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) in many low-income countries has contributed to reductions in global childhood deaths caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Many low-income countries, however, will soon reach an economic status leading to transition from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance vaccine funding support and then face increased expenditure to continue {PCV} programmes. Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of {PCV} in low-income countries will inform such country decisions. {METHODS}: We used empiric data on the costs of vaccine delivery and pneumococcal disease and {PCV} programme impact on disease among children less than 5 years old in The Gambia. We used the {UNIVAC} cost-effectiveness modelling tool to compare the impact and cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination to no vaccination over 20 birth cohorts starting in 2011. We calculated costs per disability-adjusted-life-year ({DALY}) averted from government and societal perspectives and undertook scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. {RESULTS}: We projected that, over 20 years, {PCV} in The Gambia could avert 117 000 total disease episodes in children less than 5 years old, including outpatient and hospitalised pneumonia, pneumococcal sepsis and meningitis (including sequelae). Vaccination could avert 9000 outpatient pneumonia visits, 88 000 hospitalisations and 3300 deaths due to pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. Approximately 100 000 {DALYs} are expected to be averted. Averted visits and hospitalisations represent {US}4 million in healthcare costs expected to be saved by the government and {US}7.3 million if household costs are included. The cost of the vaccination programme is estimated at {US}\$2 million. In the base scenario, most alternative scenarios and nearly 90\% of the probabilistic scenarios, pneumococcal vaccination is cost saving in The Gambia. {CONCLUSION}: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination is expected to generate substantial health gains and is likely to be cost saving in The Gambia. Policymakers in similar settings should be confident to maintain their {PCV} programmes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Pneumonia is a leading cause of death among children less than five years old during humanitarian emergencies. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the leading causes of bacterial pneumonia. Vaccines for both of these pathogens are available to prevent pneumonia. Problem This study describes an economic analysis from a publicly funded health care system perspective performed on a birth cohort in Somalia, a country that has experienced a protracted humanitarian emergency., {METHODS}: An impact and cost-effectiveness analysis was performed comparing: no vaccine, Hib vaccine only, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 10 ({PCV}10) only, and both together administered through supplemental immunization activities ({SIAs}). The main summary measure was the incremental cost per disability-adjusted life-years ({DALYs}) averted. One-way sensitivity analysis was conducted for uncertainty in parameter values., {RESULTS}: Each {SIA} would avert a substantial number of cases and deaths. Compared with no vaccine, the {DALYs} averted by two {SIAs} for two doses of Hib vaccine was {US} 202.93 (lower and upper limits: 121.80-623.52), two doses of {PCV}10 was {US} 161.51 (107.24-227.21), and two doses of both vaccines was {US} 152.42 (101.20-214.42). Variables that influenced the cost-effectiveness for each strategy most substantially were vaccine effectiveness, case fatality rates ({CFRs}), and disease burden., {CONCLUSIONS}: The World Health Organization ({WHO}) defines a cost-effective intervention as costing one to three times the per capita gross domestic product ({GDP}; in 2011, for Somalia={US} 112). Based on the presented model, Hib vaccine alone, {PCV}10 alone, or Hib vaccine and {PCV}10 given together in {SIAs} are cost-effective interventions in Somalia. The {WHO}/Strategic Advisory Group of Experts decision-making factors for vaccine deployment appear to have all been met: the disease burden is large, the vaccine-related risk is low, prevention in this setting is more feasible than treatment, the vaccine duration probably is sufficient for the vulnerable period of the child's life, cost is reasonable, and herd immunity is possible.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Financial support from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization ({GAVI}) to introduce the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}10) into the routine childhood immunization schedule in Georgia is ending in 2015. As a result, the Interagency Coordination Committee ({ICC}) decided to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis to gather additional evidence to advocate for an appropriate evidence-based decision after {GAVI} support is over. The study also aimed to strengthen national capacity to conduct cost-effectiveness studies, and to introduce economic evaluations into Georgia's decision-making process. {METHODOLOGY}: A multidisciplinary team of national experts led by a member of the {ICC} carried out the analysis that compared two scenarios: introducing {PCV}10 vs no vaccination. The {TRIVAC} model was used to evaluate 10 cohorts of children over the period 2014-2023. National data was used to inform demographics, disease burden, vaccine coverage, health service utilization, and costs. Evidence from clinical trials and the scientific literature was used to estimate the impact of the vaccine. A 3+0 schedule and a vaccine price increasing to {US} 3.50 per dose was assumed for the base-case scenario. Alternative univariate and multivariate scenarios were evaluated. {RESULTS}: Over the 10-year period, {PCV}10 was estimated to prevent 7170 (8288 undiscounted) outpatient visits due to all-cause acute otitis media, 5325 (6154 undiscounted) admissions due to all-cause pneumonia, 87 (100 undiscounted) admissions due to pneumococcal meningitis, and 508 (588 undiscounted) admissions due to pneumococcal non-pneumonia and non-meningitis ({NPNM}). In addition, the vaccine was estimated to prevent 41 (48 undiscounted) deaths. This is equivalent to approximately 5 deaths and 700 admissions prevented each year in Georgia. Over the 10-year period, {PCV}10 would cost the government approximately {US} 4.4 million (440,000 per year). However, about half of this would be offset by the treatment costs prevented. The discounted cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be {US} 1599 per {DALY} averted with scenarios ranging from {US} 286 to {US} 7787. {DISCUSSION}: This study led to better multi-sectoral collaboration and improved national capacity to perform economic evaluations. Routine infant vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae would be highly cost-effective in Georgia. The decision to introduce {PCV}10 was already made some time before the study was initiated but it provided important economic evidence in support of that decision. There are several uncertainties around many of the parameters used, but a multivariate scenario analysis with several conservative assumptions (including no herd effect in older individuals) shows that this recommendation is robust. This study supports the decision to introduce {PCV}10 in Georgia.},

Model outcomes were adjusted according to the population demographics and region-specific serotype distribution in Turkey. Health outcomes and direct healthcare costs were simulated for {PCV}-7, {PCV}-13 and {PHiD}-{CV}. {RESULTS}: {PCV}-13 and {PHiD}-{CV} are projected to have a substantial impact on pneumococcal disease in Turkey versus {PCV}-7, with 2,223 and 3,156 quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs}) and 2,146 and 2,081 life years, respectively, being saved under a 3+1 schedule. Projections of direct medical costs showed that a {PHiD}-{CV} vaccination programme would provide the greatest cost savings, offering additional savings of {US}11,718,813 versus {PCV}-7 and {US}8,235,010 versus {PCV}-13. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that {PHiD}-{CV} dominated {PCV}-13 in terms of {QALYs} gained and cost savings in 58.3\% of simulations. {CONCLUSION}: Under the modeled conditions, {PHiD}-{CV} would provide the most cost-effective intervention for reducing pneumococcal disease in Turkish children.},

We estimated the cost-effectiveness of introducing either {PCV}10 or the 13-valent vaccine ({PCV}13) from a societal perspective and explored the incremental impact of including indirect vaccine effects. {METHODS}: The costs and effects of pneumococcal vaccination among infants born in Kenya in 2010 were assessed using a decision analytic model comparing {PCV}10 or {PCV}13, in turn, with no vaccination. Direct vaccine effects were estimated as a reduction in the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis, sepsis, bacteraemic pneumonia and non-bacteraemic pneumonia. Pneumococcal disease incidence was extrapolated from a population-based hospital surveillance system in Kilifi and adjustments were made for variable access to care across Kenya. We used vaccine efficacy estimates from a trial in The Gambia and accounted for serotype distribution in Kilifi. We estimated indirect vaccine protection and serotype replacement by extrapolating from the {USA}. Multivariable sensitivity analysis was conducted using Monte Carlo simulation. We assumed a vaccine price of {US} 3.50 per dose. {FINDINGS}: The annual cost of delivering {PCV}10 was approximately {US}14 million. We projected a 42.7\% reduction in pneumococcal disease episodes leading to a {US}1.97 million reduction in treatment costs and a 6.1\% reduction in childhood mortality annually. In the base case analysis, costs per discounted {DALY} and per death averted by {PCV}10, amounted to {US} 59 (95\% {CI} 26-103) and {US} 1,958 (95\% {CI} 866-3,425), respectively. {PCV}13 introduction improved the cost-effectiveness ratios by approximately 20\% and inclusion of indirect effects improved cost-effectiveness ratios by 43-56\%. The break-even prices for introduction of {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 are {US} 0.41 and 0.51, respectively. {CONCLUSIONS}: Introducing either {PCV}10 or {PCV}13 in Kenya is highly cost-effective from a societal perspective.

Given the history of pandemic outbreaks and the associated morbidity and mortality, we investigated the cost-effectiveness of a {PCV}7 vaccination program in China from the context of typical and pandemic influenza seasons. {METHODS}: A decision-analytic model was employed to evaluate the impact of a 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine ({PCV}7) infant vaccination program on the incidence, mortality, and cost associated with pneumococcal disease during a typical influenza season (15\% flu incidence) and influenza pandemic (30\% flu incidence) in China. The model incorporated Chinese data where available and included both direct and indirect (herd) effects on the unvaccinated population, assuming a point in time following the initial introduction of the vaccine where the impact of the indirect effects has reached a steady state, approximately seven years following the implementation of the vaccine program. Pneumococcal disease incidence, mortality, and costs were evaluated over a one year time horizon. Healthcare costs were calculated using a payer perspective and included vaccination program costs and direct medical expenditures from pneumococcal disease. {RESULTS}: The model predicted that routine {PCV}7 vaccination of infants in China would prevent 5,053,453 cases of pneumococcal disease and 76,714 deaths in a single year during a normal influenza season.The estimated incremental-cost-effectiveness ratios were ¥12,281 ({US}1,900) per life-year saved and ¥13,737 ({US}2,125) per quality-adjusted-life-year gained. During an influenza pandemic, the model estimated that routine vaccination with {PCV}7 would prevent 8,469,506 cases of pneumococcal disease and 707,526 deaths, and would be cost-saving. {CONCLUSIONS}: Routine vaccination with {PCV}7 in China would be a cost-effective strategy at limiting the negative impact of influenza during a typical influenza season. During an influenza pandemic, the benefit of {PCV}7 in preventing excess pneumococcal morbidity and mortality renders a {PCV}7 vaccination program cost-saving.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Currently there are three pneumococcal conjugate vaccines with different coverage of serotypes for use in children under one year. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines of 7, 10, and 13 valences in the Colombian {EPI}. {METHODS}: A Markov model, which followed a cohort of children under one year to life expectancy, was developed. Parameters of occurrence and care costs were based on data from National Health System and literature review. {PCV}-7 is a dominated strategy. {PCV}-10 and {PCV}-13 were each compared to no vaccination or {PCV}-10 vaccination, respectively. A 2+1 schedule and a vaccination price of {US} 14.00, {US} 14.85 and {US} 16.34 per dose were assumed in the base case for {PCV}-7, -10, and {PCV}-13 vaccines. {RESULTS}: Introduction of {PCV}-13 rather than {PCV}-10 increases the number of life years gained ({LYG}). From the societal perspective, in the 'competing choice' framework cost per {LYG} was {US} 1837 with {PCV}-10 and {US}\$ 9514 with {PCV}-13, while {PCV}-7 is a dominated strategy. The {ICER} of {PCV}-13 is above the per capita Gross Domestic Product. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ({ICERs}) were influenced mainly by effectiveness against radiologically-confirmed pneumonia and {AOM}, vaccine price, and discount rate. {CONCLUSION}: Routine vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae in Colombia would be cost-effective with {PCV}-10, with {ICER} below the per-capita {GDP}, but its inclusion requires evaluating the budget impact. {PCV}-13 would prevent more disease and deaths with a higher {LYG}, but {PCV}-10 would save more cost to the healthcare system due its higher impact in the prevention of {AOM}.

At the rate of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis ({DTP}) vaccine coverage and a vaccine price of {US} 53 per dose, {PCV}7 was projected to prevent 23 474 deaths per year in children under 5 years old in the three countries studied, thus averting 884 841 disability-adjusted life years ({DALYs}) yearly.

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing a domestic pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}7-{TT}) into the Cuban National Immunization Program ({NIP}). Methods: We compared {PCV}7-{TT} given at two, four and six months of age to a scenario without {PCV}7-{TT}, over a ten-year period (2020-2029). We calculated the cost (Cuban pesos - {CUP}) per Disability Adjusted Life Year ({DALY}) averted from a Government perspective. We compared results from a static cohort model and a parsimonious prediction model informed by the serotype distribution among pneumococcal carriers and cases. We ran probabilistic and deterministic uncertainty analyses. Results: {PCV}7-{TT} could prevent 6897 (95\% uncertainty interval, 4344-8750) hospitalizations and 189 (115-253) deaths in children {\textless}5 years of age, over the period 2020-2029. This could cost around 25 million (20-31) discounted {CUP} but would be offset by treatment cost savings of around 23 million (1431). A parsimonious model predicted less favourable impact and cost-effectiveness but the cost per {DALY} averted was still less than 0.4 times the current {GDP} per capita. Conclusions: {PCV}7-{TT} is likely to be cost-effective in Cuba. The impact of the vaccine would need to be carefully monitored following its introduction into the {NIP}.

Method(s): Our previous cost-effectiveness \& cost-utility analysis of implementing a {PCV} program in the Mexican pediatric population was completed with this new scenario of no superiority between {PCVs} on Invasive Pneumococcal Disease ({IPD}) and pneumonia in children less than 5 years of age. On this scenario, all original inputs remained the same, even the price parity between vaccines, but the vaccine effectiveness against {IPD} and pneumonia were considered equal between {PCVs}. The robustness of the conclusions was assessed through a sensitivity analysis that included all of the parameters considered by the model. Result(s): In this scenario, {PHID}-{CV} was dominant over {PCV}-13 in the "cost-utility analysis"; generating more quality-adjusted life years at a lower cost and a lower incremental cost-utility ratio, based on a better profile against acute otitis media. On the "cost-effectiveness analysis", both vaccines generated equal number of life years gained, but {PCV}-13 at a higher cost. Although both vaccines produced equivalent health outcomes, in this scenario of technical parity against {IPD} and pneumonia between vaccines, the analysis predicted that {PHID}-{CV} would save 367/422 million "2013 Mexican pesos" (discounted/undiscounted), per vaccinated cohort as compared with {PCV}-13. {ConClusions}: Even though {PCV}-13 and {PHID}-{CV} were both cost-effective when used to implement a pediatric vaccination campaign for Mexico, {PHID}-{CV} had a better cost-utility/effectiveness profile based on the demonstrated differential effect against acute otitis media.},

	abstract = {Background Pneumonia and pneumococcal disease cause a large disease burden in resource-constrained settings. We pursue an extended cost-effectiveness analysis ({ECEA}) of two fully publicly financed interventions in Ethiopia: pneumococcal vaccination for newborns and pneumonia treatment for under-five children in Ethiopia. Methods We apply {ECEA} methods and estimate the program impact on: (1) government program costs; (2) pneumonia and pneumococcal deaths averted; (3) household expenses related to pneumonia/pneumococcal disease treatment averted; (4) prevention of household medical impoverishment measured by an imputed money-metric value of financial risk protection; and (5) distributional consequences across the wealth strata of the country population. Available epidemiological and cost data from Ethiopia are applied and the two interventions are assessed separately at various incremental coverage levels. Results Scaling-up pneumococcal vaccines at around 40\% coverage would cost about 11.5 million and avert about 2090 child deaths annually, while a 10\% increase of pneumonia treatment to all children under 5 years of age would cost about 13.9 million and avert 2610 deaths annually. Health benefits of the two interventions publicly financed would be concentrated among the bottom income quintile, where 30-40\% of all deaths averted would be expected to occur in the poorest quintile. In sum, the two interventions would eliminate a total of \$2.4 million of private household expenditures annually, where the richest quintile benefits from around 30\% of the total private expenditures averted. The financial risk protection benefits would be largely concentrated among the bottom income quintile. The results are most sensitive to variations in vaccine price, population size, number of deaths due to pneumonia, efficacy of interventions and out-of-pocket copayment share. Conclusions Vaccine and treatment interventions for children, as shown with the illustrative examples of pneumococcal vaccine and pneumonia treatment, can bring large health and financial benefits to households in Ethiopia, most particularly among the poorest socio-economic groups.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gambia is the second {GAVI} support-eligible country to introduce the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}7), but a country-specific cost-effectiveness analysis of the vaccine is not available. Our objective was to assess the potential impact of {PCVs} of different valences in The Gambia. {METHODS}: We synthesized the best available epidemiological and cost data using a state-transition model to simulate the natural histories of various pneumococcal diseases. For the base-case, we estimated incremental cost (in 2005 {US} dollars) per disability-adjusted life year ({DALY}) averted under routine vaccination using {PCV}9 compared to no vaccination. We extended the base-case results for {PCV}9 to estimate the cost-effectiveness of {PCV}7, {PCV}10, and {PCV}13, each compared to no vaccination. To explore parameter uncertainty, we performed both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We also explored the impact of vaccine efficacy waning, herd immunity, and serotype replacement, as a part of the uncertainty analyses, by assuming alternative scenarios and extrapolating empirical results from different settings. {RESULTS}: Assuming 90\% coverage, a program using a 9-valent {PCV} ({PCV}9) would prevent approximately 630 hospitalizations, 40 deaths, and 1000 {DALYs}, over the first 5 years of life of a birth cohort. Under base-case assumptions (3.5 per vaccine), compared to no intervention, a {PCV}9 vaccination program would cost 670 per {DALY} averted in The Gambia. The corresponding values for {PCV}7, {PCV}10, and {PCV}13 were 910, 670, and 570 per {DALY} averted, respectively. Sensitivity analyses that explored the implications of the uncertain key parameters showed that model outcomes were most sensitive to vaccine price per dose, discount rate, case-fatality rate of primary endpoint pneumonia, and vaccine efficacy against primary endpoint pneumonia. {CONCLUSIONS}: Based on the information available now, infant {PCV} vaccination would be expected to reduce pneumococcal diseases caused by S. pneumoniae in The Gambia. Assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of three times {GDP} per capita, all {PCVs} examined would be cost-effective at the tentative Advance Market Commitment ({AMC}) price of 3.5 per dose. Because the cost-effectiveness of a {PCV} program could be affected by potential serotype replacement or herd immunity effects that may not be known until after a large scale introduction, type-specific surveillance and iterative evaluation will be critical.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}13) among infants in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Karamay, Qingdao, and Suzhou. Methods: A previously published cost-effectiveness model comparing vaccination with {PCV}13 to no vaccination was localized to the included Chinese cities. A systematic literature review was undertaken to identify age-specific incidence rates for pneumococcal bacteremia, pneumococcal meningitis, pneumonia, and otitis media ({AOM}). Age-specific direct medical costs of treating the included pneumococcal diseases were taken from the Chinese Health Insurance Association database. The base case analysis evaluated vaccine efficacy using direct effect and indirect effects ({DE}+ {IDE}). A subsequent scenario analysis evaluated the model outcomes if only {DE} was considered. A vaccination rate of 70\% was used. The model reported outcomes over a one-year period after it was assumed the vaccine effects had reached a steady state (5-7 years after vaccine introduction) to include the direct and indirect effects of vaccination. Health outcomes were discounted at 5\% during the steady-state period. Results: Vaccination with {PCV}13 was cost-effective in the base case analysis for all included cities with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ({ICER}) ranging from 1145 {CNY}(Shenzhen) to 15,422 {CNY} (Qingdao) per quality-adjusted life-year ({QALY}) gained. {PCV}13 was the dominant strategy in Shanghai with lower incremental costs and higher incremental {QALYs}. {PCV}13 remained cost-effective in the {DE}-only analysis with all {ICERs} falling below a cost-effectiveness threshold of three times {GDP} per capita in each city. Conclusions: Vaccination with {PCV}13 was a cost-effective strategy in the analyzed cities for both the {DE}-only and {DE} + {IDE} analyses. {PCV}13 became very cost-effective when a vaccination rate was reached where {IDE} is observed.},

Methods: An economic evaluation was performed using a Markov simulation model. Parameters including demographic, epidemiological data, costs and efficacy of vaccines were obtained from previous studies. A hypothetical cohort of 100,000 newborns (focusing on pneumococcal diseases {\textless}= 7 years old) was followed up until death or 100 years of age. The model incorporated the impact of vaccination on reduction of incidence of pneumococcal diseases and mortality of children {\textless}= 7 years. Outcomes are presented in terms of disease cases averted, quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs}) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Results: Under baseline assumptions, {PPV}-23 is currently the only cost-effective option, whereas {PCV}-13 showed the greatest impact on pneumococcal disease burden, reducing invasive pneumococcal diseases by 31.3\%, pneumonia by 15.3\% and gaining 73.8 {QALYs} (10,000 individuals at discount rate of 3\%). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of {PCV}-13 and {PCV}-7 are {US} 29,460/{QALY} and {US} 104,094/{QALY}, respectively, showing no cost-effectiveness based on the World Health Organization recommended willingness-to-pay threshold. On the other hand, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of {PCVs} were most sensitive to vaccination costs; if it reduces 4.7\% and 32.2\% for {PCV}-7 and {PCV}-13, respectively, the vaccination will be cost-effective. Conclusions: To scale up current vaccination strategies and achieve potential health benefits, the replacement of {PCV}-7 with {PCV}-13 should be considered. As well, {PCV}'s costs need to be reduced by increasing public subsidies and providing financial support to poor families.},

	abstract = {Background: Cost-effectiveness studies have been increasingly part of decision processes for incorporating new vaccines into the Brazilian National Immunisation Program. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}10) in the universal childhood immunisation programme in Brazil. Method(s): A decision-tree analytical model based on the {ProVac} Initiative pneumococcus model was used, following 25 successive cohorts from birth until 5 years of age. Two strategies were compared: (1) status quo and (2) universal childhood immunisation programme with {PCV}10. Epidemiological and cost estimates for pneumococcal disease were based on National Health Information Systems and literature. A 'top-down' costing approach was employed. Costs are reported in 2004 Brazilian reals. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3\%. Results 25 years after implementing the {PCV}10 immunisation programme, 10 226 deaths, 360 657 disability-adjusted life years ({DALYs}), 433 808 hospitalisations and 5 117 109 outpatient visits would be avoided. The cost of the immunisation programme would be R10 674 478 765, and the expected savings on direct medical costs and family costs would be R1 036 958 639 and R209 919 404, respectively. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of R778 145/death avoided and R\$22 066/{DALY} avoided from the society perspective. Conclusion(s): The {PCV}10 universal infant immunisation programme is a cost-effective intervention (1-3 {GDP} per capita/{DALY} avoided). Owing to the uncertain burden of disease data, as well as unclear long-term vaccine effects, surveillance systems to monitor the long-term effects of this programme will be essential.},

	abstract = {Background The burden of pneumococcal disease in China is high, and a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}13) recently received regulatory approval and is available to Chinese infants. {PCV}13 protects against the most prevalent serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease ({IPD}) in China, but will not provide full societal benefits until made broadly available through a national immunization program ({NIP}). Objective To estimate clinical and economic benefits of introducing {PCV}13 into a {NIP} in China using local cost estimates and accounting for variability in vaccine uptake and indirect (herd protection) effects. Methods We developed a population model to estimate the effect of {PCV}13 introduction in China. Modeled health states included meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia ({PNE}), acute otitis media, death and sequelae, and no disease. Direct healthcare costs and disease incidence data for {IPD} and {PNE} were derived from the China Health Insurance and Research Association database; all other parameters were derived from published literature. We estimated total disease cases and associated costs, quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs}), and deaths for three scenarios from a Chinese Payer Perspective: (1) direct effects only, (2) direct+indirect effects for {IPD} only, and (3) direct+indirect effects for {IPD} and inpatient {PNE}. Results Scenario (1) resulted in 370.3 thousand {QALYs} gained and 12.8 thousand deaths avoided versus no vaccination. In scenarios (2) and (3), the {PCV}13 {NIP} gained 383.2 thousand and 3,580 thousand {QALYs}, and avoided 13.1 thousand and 147.5 thousand deaths versus no vaccination, respectively. In all three scenarios, the vaccination cost was offset by cost reductions from prevented disease yielding net costs of (sic)29,362.32 million, (sic)29,334.29 million, and (sic)13,524.72 million, respectively. All resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios fell below a 2x China {GDP} cost-effectiveness threshold across a range of potential vaccine prices. Discussion Initiation of a {PCV}13 {NIP} in China incurs large upfront costs but is good value for money, and is likely to prevent substantial cases of disease among children and non-vaccinated individuals.},

A compartmental, static model with a 1-year time period for a steady-state population that allowed for the incorporation of direct and indirect (i.e., herd immunity and serotype replacement) vaccine effects across all age groups was used. Cases of disease prevented, deaths prevented, life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and incremental costs in the steady-state year were calculated for {PHiD}-{CV} compared with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}-7). A short-term analysis was also conducted to estimate the incremental difference in disease and cost outcomes for the two vaccines within the first 10 years. All costs were in 2008 local currency. In all four countries, the model estimated that {PHiD}-{CV} prevented more cases of disease, prevented more deaths, and resulted in more life-years and quality-adjusted life-years compared with {PCV}-7 in both the short term and the steady-state year. Assuming price parity for the vaccines, the model projected that routine vaccination with {PHiD}-{CV} resulted in lower costs compared with {PCV}-7 in both the short term and the steady-state year. Scenario analysis showed the incremental cost savings for {PHiD}-{CV} compared with {PCV}-7 in the steady-state year were sensitive to assumptions regarding duration of vaccine efficacy.

	abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to be the most important causative agent of invasive bacterial infections in children and is the most common cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in children less than 5 years of age. Due to some conditions in the Latin America region, economic assessments of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ({PCVs}) have unique characteristics. First, distribution of S. pneumoniae serotypes, and thus coverage by vaccines that incorporate certain serotypes, varies within the region and compared with other parts of the world. Second, the mortality rate of pneumococcal infections in developing countries is significantly higher than in the {US} and Europe. Third, the economies of the Latin American region are very different from those of developed countries. For these reasons, the Pan American Health Organization ({PAHO}) is promoting the need for economic valuation studies of the impact of pneumococcal vaccines Latin America. Given the importance of pneumonia in the burden of pneumococcal disease in Latin America, the number of pneumonia cases prevented by the vaccine has a large impact on the economic valuation of {PCVs}, due to a strong correlation with numbers of deaths averted, quality-adjusted life-years ({QALYs}) gained or disability-adjusted life-years ({DALYs}) avoided. In terms of cost, analysis of impact on acute otitis media (short-term) and sequelae (long-term) show a significant and important expenditure avoided by vaccination. Cost-effectiveness is significantly modified by vaccine cost, mortality due to pneumonia, vaccine efficacy/effectiveness and herd immunity. Finally the validity of certain assumptions based on the uncertainty of the data should be considered in economic assessments of new {PCVs}. These include assumptions related to the impact on otitis media, estimates of efficacy/effectiveness based on measured antibody levels and the extrapolation to {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 of previous experience with {PCV}7. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to compare, from a Chinese societal perspective, the projected health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of adding pneumococcal conjugate heptavalent vaccine ({PCV}-7) to the routine compulsory child immunization schedule. Methods: A decision-tree model, with data and assumptions adapted for relevance to China, was developed to project the health outcomes of {PCV}-7 vaccination (compared with no vaccination) over a 5-year period as well as a lifetime. The vaccinated birth cohort included 16,000,000 children in China. A 2 + 1 dose schedule at {US}136.51 per vaccine dose was used in the base-case analysis. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of the model. The impact of a net indirect effect (herd immunity) was evaluated. Outcomes are presented in terms of the saved disease burden, costs, quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs}) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Results: In a Chinese birth cohort, a {PCV}-7 vaccination program would reduce the number of pneumococcus-related infections by at least 32\% and would prevent 2,682 deaths in the first 5 years of life, saving 1,190 million in total costs and gaining an additional 9,895 {QALYs} (discounted by 3\%). The incremental cost per {QALY} was estimated to be 530,354. When herd immunity was taken into account, the cost per {QALY} was estimated to be 95,319. The robustness of the model was influenced mainly by the {PCV}-7 cost per dose, effectiveness herd immunity and incidence of pneumococcal diseases. With and without herd immunity, the break-even costs in China were 29.05 and 25.87, respectively. Conclusions: Compulsory routine infant vaccination with {PCV}-7 is projected to substantially reduce pneumococcal disease morbidity, mortality, and related costs in China. However, a universal vaccination program with {PCV}-7 is not cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold that is currently recommended for China by the World Health Organization.},

To reduce this burden, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV} 10) was introduced into the general childhood national immunization program in Ethiopia in 2011. However, there is little evidence on its cost-effectiveness, and the aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the introduction of {PCV} 10 vaccination in the Ethiopian setting. {METHOD}(S): The cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out based on a quasi-experimental evaluation of implementing {PCV} 10 at the Butajira rural health program site in Ethiopia. The intervention and the control groups consisted 876 and 1010 children, respectively. Using data from program site's surveillance system database as a framework, health outcome and vaccination data were collected from medical records, immunization registration books and reports. Disability- Adjusted Life Year ({DALY}) was a main health outcome metric complimented by incidence of acute lower respiratory infection/1000-person years. Vaccination and treatment costs were collected by document review and cross-sectional household survey. {RESULT}(S): In the intervention cohort, 626 of 876 (71.5\%) children received {PCV} 10 vaccination. Until the first year of life, the incidence of acute lower respiratory infection was higher in the intervention group. After the first year of life, the incidence rate was 35.2 per 1000-person years in the intervention group compared to 60.4 per 1000-person years in the control group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ({ICER}) per averted {DALY} for the intervention group during the total follow-up period was (2013 {US}) 394.3 (undiscounted) and 413.8 (discounted). The {ICER} per averted {DALY} excluding the first year of life was (2013 {US}) 225 (undiscounted) and 292.7 (discounted). {CONCLUSION}(S): Compared to the {WHO}'s suggested cost-effectiveness threshold value, the results indicate that the general childhood {PCV} 10 vaccination was a cost-effective intervention in the Butajira rural health program site.},

South Korea implemented the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}7) in 2003, replaced with the 10-valent ({PCV}10) and 13-valent ({PCV}13) vaccine in 2010. In 2014, both vaccines were introduced in the national immunization program ({NIP}) for infants with 3 primary doses and one booster dose We performed a cost-effectiveness evaluation to elucidate which vaccine may be expected to provide greater impact if included in a {NIP}. Methodology: Using an established model, we estimated the impact of introducing either {PCV}13 or {PCV}10 into the South Korean {NIP} in 2015. Vaccine impact was based on historic observed impact of {PCV}13 from 2010 to 2015 in Korea given high uptake of {PCV}13, and {PCV}10 impact was estimated based on experiences in countries using {PCV}10. Incidence and costs for all ages and including invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media were derived from the literature and Health Insurance Review and Assessment database. Result(s): In the base-case, over 5-years {PCV}13 was estimated to avert 550,000 more cases of pneumococcal disease compared to {PCV}10, driven by broader serotype coverage and less replacement due to serotypes 3 and 19A. This translated to a cost-savings of 47.4 million {USD} despite {PCV}13's higher cost. Sensitivity analysis found incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ({ICERs}) ranged from cost-saving to 7,300 {USD} per quality-adjusted life year ({QALY}). Conclusion(s): A {NIP} using {PCV}13 was estimated to have a more substantial public health impact and be cost-saving compared to a program with {PCV}10 due to broader serotype coverage.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

Method(s): Two vaccination schedules were considered: two-dose primary series plus a booster dose (2. +. 1) and three-dose primary series plus a booster dose (3. +. 1). A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a societal perspective. A Markov simulation model was used to estimate the relevant costs and health outcomes for a lifetime horizon. Costs were collected and values were calculated for the year 2010. The results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ({ICERs}) in Thai Baht ({THB}) per quality adjusted life year ({QALY}) gained, with future costs and outcomes being discounted at 3\% per annum. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation were performed to assess parameter uncertainty. Result(s): Under the base case-scenario of 2. +. 1 dose schedule and a five-year protection, without indirect vaccine effects, the {ICER} for {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 were {THB} 1,368,072 and {THB} 1,490,305 per {QALY} gained, respectively. With indirect vaccine effects, the {ICER} of {PCV}10 was {THB} 519,399, and for {PCV}13 was {THB} 527,378. The model was sensitive to discount rate, the change in duration of vaccine protection and the incidence of pneumonia for all age groups. Conclusion(s): At current prices, {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 are not cost-effective in Thailand. Inclusion of indirect vaccine effects substantially reduced the {ICERs} for both vaccines, but did not result in cost effectiveness. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: The clinical and economic burden associated with invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae ({NTHi}) diseases is substantial in the Latin America and Caribbean region, where pneumococcal vaccines have only been introduced to a few countries. This study analyzed the cost-effectiveness and cost utility of three different pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ({PCVs}) for Peru. Methods: A Markov model that simulated the disease processes in a birth cohort over a lifetime, within 1,128 month cycles was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 10-valent pneumococcal {NTHi} protein D conjugate vaccine ({PHiD}-{CV}) and 7- and 13-valent {PCVs} ({PCV}-7 and {PCV}-13). Expected quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs}), cost-savings and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ({ICERs}) were calculated. Results: Without vaccination, pneumonia was associated with the greatest health economic burden (90\% of {QALYs} lost and 63\% of lifetime direct medical costs); while acute otitis media ({AOM}) was responsible for 1\% of {QALYs} lost and 25\% of direct medical costs. All vaccines were predicted to be cost-effective for Peru, with {PHiD}-{CV} being most cost-effective. {PHiD}-{CV} was predicted to generate 50 more {QALYs} gained and required a reduced investment (-{US}\$ 3.4 million) versus {PCV}-13 (discounted data), and was therefore dominant and cost saving. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that {PHiD}-{CV} generated more {QALYs} gained at a reduced cost than {PCV}-13 in 84\% of the simulations and less {QALYs} gains at a reduced cost in 16\%. Additional scenarios using different assumptions on vaccine efficacies based on previous evidence were explored, but no significant change in the overall cost-effective results were observed. Conclusions: The results of this modeling study predict that {PCVs} are likely to be a cost-effective strategy to help relieve the epidemiological and economic burden associated with pediatric pneumococcal and {NTHi} diseases for Peru. {PHiD}-{CV} is likely to be a dominant (better health gains at a reduced net cost) intervention compared to {PCV}-13 or {PCV}-7. The most significant drivers for these results are the better health and economic profile of {PHiD}-{CV} against {AOM} and its reduced cost per dose available through the {PAHO} Revolving Fund in the {LAC} region.},

	abstract = {Background: Pneumococcal disease is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death in children younger than 5 years of age worldwide. The World Health Organization recommends pneumococcal conjugate vaccine as a priority for inclusion into national childhood immunization programmes. Pneumococcal vaccine has yet to be included as part of the national vaccination programme in Malaysia although it has been available in the country since 2005. This study sought to estimate the disease burden of pneumococcal disease in Malaysia and to assess the cost effectiveness of routine infant vaccination with {PCV}7. Method(s): A decision model was adapted taking into consideration prevalence, disease burden, treatment costs and outcomes for pneumococcal disease severe enough to result in a hospital admission. Disease burden were estimated from the medical records of 6 hospitals. Where local data was unavailable, model inputs were obtained from international and regional studies and from focus group discussions. The model incorporated the effects of herd protection on the unvaccinated adult population. Result(s): At current vaccine prices, {PCV}7 vaccination of 90\% of a hypothetical 550,000 birth cohort would incur costs of {RM} 439.6 million ({US}128 million). Over a 10 year time horizon, vaccination would reduce episodes of pneumococcal hospitalisation by 9,585 cases to 73,845 hospitalisations with cost savings of {RM} 37.5 million ({US}10.9 million) to the health system with 11,422.5 life years saved at a cost effectiveness ratio of {RM} 35,196 ({US}10,261) per life year gained. Conclusion(s): {PCV}7 vaccination of infants is expected to be cost-effective for Malaysia with an incremental cost per life year gained of {RM} 35,196 ({US}10,261).

This study compared introducing {PHiD}-{CV} (10 valent vaccine) with current no vaccination, as well as against the alternative 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}13). Method(s): A lifetime Markov cohort model was adapted using national estimates of disease burden, outcomes of pneumococcal disease, and treatment costs of disease manifestations including pneumonia, acute otitis media, septicemia, and meningitis for a hypothetical birth cohort of 550,000 infants. Clinical information was obtained by review of medical records from four public hospitals in Malaysia from the year 2008 to 2009. Inpatient cost from the four study hospitals was obtained from a diagnostic-related group-based costing system. Outpatient cost was estimated using clinical pathways developed by an expert panel. The perspective assessed was that of the Ministry of Health, Malaysia. Result(s): The estimated disease incidence was 1.2, 3.7, 70, and 6.9 per 100,000 population for meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and acute otitis media, respectively. The Markov model predicted medical costs of Malaysian ringgit ({RM}) 4.86 billion ({US} 1.51 billion) in the absence of vaccination. Vaccination with {PHiD}-{CV} would be highly cost-effective against no vaccination at {RM}30,290 ({US} 7,407) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. On comparing {PHiD}-{CV} with {PCV}13, it was found that {PHiD}-{CV} dominates {PCV}13, with 179 quality-adjusted life-years gained while saving {RM}35 million ({US} \$10.87 million). Conclusion(s): It is cost-effective to incorporate pneumococcal vaccination in the National Immunization Programme of Malaysia.

	abstract = {Background: Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ({PCVs}) has substantially reduced disease burden due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality globally. However, {PCVs} are among the most expensive vaccines, hindering their introduction in some settings and threatening sustainability in others. We aimed to assess the effect and cost-effectiveness of introduction of 13-valent {PCV} ({PCV}13) vaccination globally. Method(s): We assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of {PCV}13 introduction by integrating two models: an ecological model (a parsimonious, mechanistic model validated with data from post-seven-valent {PCV} introduction in 13 high-income settings) to predict the effect of {PCV} on childhood invasive pneumococcal disease, and a decision-tree model to predict a range of clinical presentations and economic outcomes under vaccination and no-vaccination strategies. The models followed 30 birth cohorts up to age 5 years in 180 countries from 2015 to 2045. One-way scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were done to explore model uncertainties. Finding(s): We estimate that global {PCV}13 use could prevent 0.399 million child deaths (95\% credible interval 0.208 million to 0.711 million) and 54.6 million disease episodes (51.8 million to 58.1 million) annually. Global vaccine costs (in 2015 international dollars) of 15.5 billion could be partially offset by health-care savings of 3.19 billion (2.62 billion to 3.92 billion) and societal cost savings of 2.64 billion (2.13 billion to 3.28 billion). {PCV}13 use is probably cost-effective in all six {UN} regions. The 71 countries eligible for support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, account for 83\% of {PCV}13-preventable deaths but only 18\% of global vaccination costs. The expected cost of {PCV} vaccination globally is around 16 billion per year. Interpretation(s): Our findings highlight the value of Gavi's support for {PCV} introduction in low-income countries and of efforts to improve the affordability of {PCVs} in countries not eligible for, or transitioning from, Gavi support.

Given recent changes in the evidence of efficacy, herd effects and price, a {CEA} of {PCVs} should be revisited. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 compared to no {PCV} vaccination in Thai children. Material(s) and Method(s): A Markov model was developed under a societal perspective with a lifetime horizon. Inputs were derived from a comprehensive literature review. Costs were calculated using the Thai National Electronic Database and converted to the year 2017 value. All costs and outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3\%. The findings were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ({ICERs}) in Thai Baht ({THB}) per quality-adjusted life year ({QALY}) gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was generated with the cost-effectiveness threshold of 160,000 {THB}/{QALY}. Result(s): Base-case analysis of 2 + 1 dose schedule and five-year protection, with no consideration of herd effect showed that {ICER} for {PCV}10 was 170,437 {THB}/{QALY}, while {ICER} for {PCV}13 was 73,674 {THB}/{QALY}. With consideration of herd effect, both {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 had lower costs and higher {QALYs} compared to no {PCV} vaccination.

Colombian adopted {PCV}10 universal vaccination, but {PCV} incremental impact need to be revalued. The objective of this analysis was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of switch to {PCV}13 versus continue {PCV}10 in Colombian children. Method(s): A complete economic analysis was carried-out assessing potential epidemiological and economic impact of switching from {PCV}10 to {PCV}13. Epidemiological information on {PCV}10 impact was obtained from lab-based epidemiological surveillance on pneumococcal isolates at the Colombian National Institute of Health. Economic inputs were extracted from the literature. Incremental {PCV}13 effectiveness was based in additional serotypes included. Comparisons among alternatives were evaluated with the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio ({ICER}) at a willingness to pay of one {GDP} per capita ({USD} 6631) per Year of Live Saved ({YLS}). All costs were reported in 2014USD. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed, and 95\% confidence interval reported. Result(s): After four years using {PCV}10 for universal vaccination on children the Colombian health surveillance system showed a relative increment on non {PCV}10 isolates. To change from {PCV}10 to {PCV}13 would avoid 587 ({CI}95\% -49-1008) ambulatory Rx community-acquired pneumoniae ({CAP}), 1622 ({CI}95\% 591-2343) Inpatient {RxCAP}, 10 ({CI} 95\% 6-11) pneumococcal meningitis, and 79 ({CI}95\% 76-98) deaths. {ICER} per {YLS} was {USD} 2319 ({CI}95\% Dominated - {USD} 4225) for Keep-{PCV}10 and {USD} 1771 ({CI}95\% {USD}\$ 1285-9884) for Switch-to {PCV}13.

Objective(s): To determine the cost-utility of 10- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ({PCV}10 and {PCV}13) compared to no vaccination in Bhutan. Method(s): A model-based cost-utility analysis was performed in the Bhutanese context using a government perspective. A Markov simulation model with one-year cycle length was used to estimate the costs and outcomes of three options: {PCV}10, {PCV}13 and no {PCV} programmes for a lifetime horizon. A discount rate of 3\% per annum was applied. Results are presented using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ({ICER}) in United State Dollar per quality-adjusted life year ({QALY}) gained ({USD} 1 = Ngultrum 65). A one-way sensitivity analysis and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess uncertainty. Result(s): Compared to no vaccination, {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 gained 0.0006 and 0.0007 {QALYs} with additional lifetime costs of {USD} 0.02 and {USD} 0.03 per person, respectively. {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 generated {ICERs} of {USD} 36 and {USD} 40 per {QALY} gained compared to no vaccination. In addition, {PCV}13 produced an {ICER} of {USD} 92 compared with {PCV}10.

The model simulated the impact of pneumococcal and {NTHi} related diseases (Invasive Disease ({ID}), Community Acquired Pneumonia ({CAP}), and Acute Otitis Media ({AOM})) in an argentinean cohort followed over lifetime.

Aim(s): This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing {PCV}-13 in the national immunization programme for children under 5 years in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Method(s): The {TRIVAC} decision support model was used to estimate total costs of introducing {PCV}-13 and the disabili-ty-adjusted life years ({DALYs}) averted. The main pneumococcal diseases were considered-pneumonia, meningitis, acute otitis media, and non-pneumonia, non-meningitis infections-in terms of hospital admissions, outpatient visits and deaths. Local data were used to estimate costs. Result(s): Pneumococcal disease is estimated to affect 18 713 211 children under 5 years (519 412 pneumonia, 18 148 116 acute otitis media, 6884 meningitis, and 38 799 non-pneumonia, non-meningitis) in 10 years (2014-2023) without use of the vaccine. Introduction of {PCV}-13 would prevent 4 900 084 cases of pneumococcal disease (190 849 pneumonia, 4 692 450 acute otitis media, 2529 meningitis, and 14 256 non-pneumonia, non-meningitis). Pneumococcal infection would cause 287 950 hospital admissions and 29 399 deaths; vaccination could avert 105 802 hospital admissions and 9997 deaths. The incremental cost-effectiveness was estimated to be {US} 1890 and {US} 1538 per averted {DALY} for the government and society respectively. Conclusion(s): According to {WHO}-recommended thresholds for interpreting cost-effectiveness, introduction of {PCV}-13 for children under 5 years in the Islamic Republic of Iran would be cost-effective.Copyright © World Health Organization ({WHO}) 2019.},

	abstract = {Background Introduction of new vaccines in low- and lower middle-income countries has accelerated since Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance was established in 2000. This study sought to (i) estimate the costs of introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, rotavirus vaccine and a second dose of measles vaccine in Zambia; and (ii) assess affordability of the new vaccines in relation to Gavi's co-financing and eligibility policies. Methods Data on 'one-time' costs of cold storage expansions, training and social mobilisation were collected from the government and development partners. A detailed economic cost study of routine immunisation based on a representative sample of 51 health facilities provided information on labour and vaccine transport costs. Gavi co-financing payments and immunisation programme costs were projected until 2022 when Zambia is expected to transition from Gavi support. The ability of Zambia to self-finance both new and traditional vaccines was assessed by comparing these with projected government health expenditures. Results 'One-time' costs of introducing the three vaccines amounted to {US} 0.28 per capita. The new vaccines increased annual immunisation programme costs by 38\%, resulting in economic cost per fully immunised child of {US} 102. Co-financing payments on average increased by 10\% during 2008-2017, but must increase 49\% annually between 2017 and 2022. In 2014, the government spent approximately 6\% of its health expenditures on immunisation. Assuming no real budget increases, immunisation would account for around 10\% in 2022. Vaccines represented 1\% of government, non-personnel expenditures for health in 2014, and would be 6\% in 2022, assuming no real budget increases. Conclusion While the introduction of new vaccines is justified by expected positive health impacts, long-term affordability will be challenging in light of the current economic climate in Zambia. The government needs to both allocate more resources to the health sector and seek efficiency gains within service provision.Copyright © 2016 The Authors},

	abstract = {Objective: To estimate the economic impact of the introduction of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}-7) in high risk populations of Colombia. Method(s): A full economic evaluation was done regarding potential introduction of {PCV}-7. A cost-effectiveness study from the perspective of the third payer was done using a Decision Model. The model considered two alternatives: with and without vaccination. As measurement of results the avoided events were taken [cases, hospitalizations, deaths and Life-Years Saved ({LYS})]. In addition the net costs and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ({ICER}) were evaluated. Result(s): In a cohort of 70 thousand children of under 2 years old in situation of high risk, can generate 532 deaths that would produce a little more than 21 thousand Years of Life Lost ({YLL}) with costs between 7.7 and 13.3 million dollars. If we vaccinate this same cohort the deaths can be reduced to 355, and the costs of burden of disease would be between 5.7 and 10 million dollars. It is estimated a reduction of 25\% of the costs of burden of disease and of 33\% of the deaths. In addition the {ICER} by {YLS} would be between 590 and 762 dollars.

Partial vaccination of 25\% and 50\% of the birth cohort yielded considerably higher {ICER} values that are still below the country ceiling threshold of Php 170,000 per {QALY} gained, because of the loss of herd protection. The analysis also found that with a partial vaccination strategy of the government, having at least 10\% of the target cohort self-pay a higher market price of Php 2.056 for {PCV}10 and Php 3,545 for {PCV}13 would make vaccination cost-ineffective, because of the high out-of-pocket costs. Conclusion(s): The inclusion of {PCV} in the national immunization program with either universal or partial coverage would be a cost-effective intervention in the Philippines compared to no vaccination.

It also includes the newest clinical evidence evaluating the efficacy of {PCV}10, which is lacking in other previous studies. Method(s): A cost-utility analysis was conducted. A Markov simulation model was constructed to examine the costs and consequences of {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 against the current scenario of no {PCV} vaccination for a lifetime horizon. A health system perspective was employed to explore different funding schemes, which include universal or partial vaccination coverage subsidized by the government. Results were presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ({ICERs}) in Philippine peso (Php) per {QALY} gained (1 {USD} = 44.20 Php). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of parameter uncertainty. Result(s): With universal vaccination at a cost per dose of Php 624 for {PCV}10 and Php 700 for {PCV}13, both {PCVs} are cost-effective compared to no vaccination given the ceiling threshold of Php 120,000 per {QALY} gained, yielding {ICERs} of Php 68,182 and Php 54,510 for {PCV}10 and {PCV}13, respectively. Partial vaccination of 25\% of the birth cohort resulted in significantly higher {ICER} values (Php 112,640 for {PCV}10 and Php 84,654 for {PCV}13) due to loss of herd protection. The budget impact analysis reveals that universal vaccination would cost Php 3.87 billion to 4.34 billion per annual, or 1.6 to 1.8 times the budget of the current national vaccination program. Conclusion(s): The inclusion of {PCV} in the national immunization program is recommended. {PCV}13 achieved better value for money compared to {PCV}10.

Method(s): A decision-analytic model designed for pneumococcal disease and outcomes of pneumococcal infection was populated with local, age-specific incidence and cost data to estimate the expected economic benefits from vaccinating a birth cohort of 172,183 infants in Shanghai over a 1-year period using a cross-sectional approach. The analysis was assumed to occur in a year at which time the direct and indirect effects of vaccination have reached a steady state.

Result(s): The model predicts that 112,629 cases of pneumococcal-related disease could be prevented during a given year following the introduction of the {PCV}7 vaccine into the City Immunity Program in Shanghai, leading to a reduction of 187,923,359 ({US} 29,067,790) in direct medical costs. Overall, the inclusion of the {PCV}7 vaccine is estimated to have a cost-per-life-year saved of 37,468 ({US} 5,796) and a cost-per-quality-adjusted-life-year gained of 41,603 ({US} \$6,435) when both the direct and indirect effects of the vaccine resulting from herd protection are taken into account.

	abstract = {Background: World Health Organization has recommended the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) in the childhood immunisation programme of all the countries in the world. In lieu of its introduction in India, there is a need to generate evidence on cost-effectiveness of this vaccine. The current study looks into the impact and cost-effectiveness of {PCV} vaccine in India. Method(s): We evaluated the cost effectiveness of implementation of {PCV} 13 vaccination program at national level by comparing with no vaccination program for a period of 10 birth cohorts from 2018 to 2027. {UNIVAC}, a deterministic static cohort model is developed by giving the conservative estimates of vaccine program related to mortality, disease event rates, vaccine efficacy and coverage projections, system and health care costs for the first five years of life. Cost effectiveness is reported as Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio ({ICER}). Further scenario and sensitivity analysis were done. Probability of {PCV} intervention to be cost effective at a willingness to pay ({WTP}) threshold equal to per capita gross domestic product ({GDP}) is calculated using the government perspective. Result(s): We found that the introduction of {PCV} vaccination program can cost an additional 467 ({INR} 31,666) for averting per {DALY} which is less than one time {GDP} per capita of India. Even with the most unfavourable scenario for {PCV} vaccine, cost per {DALY} averted is found to be 2323 ({INR} 1,57,520) which is still a cost effective intervention in India. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found the {ICER} for {PCV} to be 649 ({INR} 44,008) with 95\% {CI}: 374-\$1161. Conclusion(s): This study shows that the {PCV} program is a highly cost effective intervention and justifies the introduction of {PCV} into routine immunisation schedule in some of the states and recommends introducing it throughout the country to reduce morbidity and mortality among the under-five children.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Methods: A decision-analytic model designed for pneumococcal disease and outcomes of pneumococcal infection was populated with local age-specific incidence and mortality data to estimate the expected health benefits of vaccinating birth cohorts of approximately 16 million infants per year over a 10-year time horizon in China. The model incorporates both the direct impact on vaccinated children and the indirect effect of herd protection on unvaccinated children and adults. Results: The model predicts that more than 16.2 million cases of pneumococcal disease and 709 411 deaths could be prevented in China over the initial 10-year period following the introduction of the {PCV}7 vaccine. The majority of these health benefits are due to the indirect effectiveness of the vaccine on the unvaccinated population, resulting in approximately 10.8 million cases prevented and 636 371 lives saved over 10 years.

Method(s): The integrated {TRIVAC} vaccine cost-effectiveness model (version 2.0) jointly developed by the Pan American Health Organization's {ProVac} Initiative and the London School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine was applied from the government and societal perspectives to estimate the cost-effectiveness ({CE}) of {PCV} introduction during 2010 and 2011. The cost-effectiveness ratios of {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 were separately compared to non-vaccination. The model calculated health and economic benefits of vaccination for 10 birth cohorts of children {\textless}5 years of age. A base case scenario with two primary doses at 2 and 4 months and a booster dose at 12 months (2. +. 1 schedule) and alternate scenarios with varying parameters were considered. Result(s): With {PCV}10 introduction, the incremental costs of the vaccination program would be approximately {US} 67 million to vaccinate all 10 cohorts of children; with {PCV}13, {US} 87 million. Health services costs avoided by the government with {PCV}10 would be {US} 19.5 million; with {PCV} 13, {US} 17.7 million. From the societal perspective, savings were much greater: with {PCV}10, {US} 43 million; with {PCV}13, {US} 35 million. For the higher priced {PCV}13, the average cost-effectiveness ratio was better than for {PCV}10 when compared to no vaccination, but regardless both were cost effective for government and society based on a threshold of 3x {GDP} per capita in Paraguay (2009 {US}\$ 2516). The number of averted meningitis and all-cause pneumonia cases and deaths was greater with {PCV}13 than with {PCV}10 when compared to no vaccination. Conclusion(s): The introduction of either {PCV}10 or {PCV}13 would be cost effective when compared to no vaccination, and in some scenarios, highly cost effective in Paraguay.

However, in recent years, there has been significant progressive increases in pneumococcal disease attributed to serotypes 3, 6A, and 19A, which are covered by the 13-valent {PCV} ({PCV}13). We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of switching from {PCV}10 to {PCV}13 for Brazilian infants from a payer perspective. A decision-analytic model was adapted to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes of continuing {PCV}10 or switching to {PCV}13. The analysis estimated future costs (\${BRL}), quality-adjusted life-years ({QALYs}), and health outcomes for {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 over 5 y. Input parameters were from published sources. Future serotype dynamics were predicted using Brazilian and global historical trends. Over 5 y, {PCV}13 could prevent 12,342 bacteremia, 15,330 meningitis, 170,191 hospitalized pneumonia, and 25,872 otitis media cases, avert 13,709 pneumococcal disease deaths, gain 20,317 {QALYs}, and save 172 million direct costs compared with {PCV}10. The use of {PCV}13 in the Brazilian {NIP} could reduce pneumococcal disease, improve population health, and save substantial health-care costs.

Method(s): A decision-analytic model was programmed in Microsoft {ExcelTM} and adapted to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes of {PCV} vaccination. Assuming a steady state, the model estimated invasive pneumococcal disease ({IPD}; bacteremia and meningitis), all-cause pneumonia (inpatient and outpatient), and all-cause otitis media cases as well as the associated costs from a payer perspective. The base case scenario assumed direct effects for both {PCVs} and indirect effects (against {IPD}) for {PCV}13 only. Result(s): In Algeria, compared with no vaccination program, {PCV}13 would save 2177 lives and avoid nearly 349,000 cases of {IPD}, pneumonia, and {AOM} at a highly cost-effective value of 308 per {QALY}. In Tunisia, {PCV}13 would save 308 lives and avoid 1305 cases of {IPD}, 4833 cases of pneumonia, and 54,957 cases of {AOM} at a highly cost-effective value of 848 per {QALY}. {PCV}10 prevented 1224 deaths and 270,483 cases of disease in Algeria and prevented 172 deaths and 56,610 cases in Tunisia. {PCV}10 was cost-effective in both Algeria at 731/{QALY} and in Tunisia at 1366/{QALY}. Conclusion(s): The ongoing {NIP} in Algeria is projected to reduce the impact and economic toll of pneumococcal disease in Algeria. If an {NIP} were also introduced in Tunisia, a commensurate impact would be expected. {PCV} {NIPs} are highly cost-effective, highly impactful public health interventions.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) is a leading cause of invasive and noninvasive bacterial disease in children. 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}-7) has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of pneumococcal diseases, such as meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and otitis media. Although {PCV}-7 was introduced in Korea in 2003, it is not yet included in the universal immunization program. {OBJECTIVE}(S): To evaluate the health outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination with {PCV}-7 in Korean infants and to estimate the break-even price for {PCV}-7 from a societal perspective. {METHOD}(S): A decision analytic model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of immunization with {PCV}-7 in a birth cohort of Korean infants born in 2006. A universal vaccination strategy was compared with no vaccination in terms of costs and life years gained ({LYG}) over a 5-year time horizon. The birth cohort size, incidence of disease, resource utilization, and associated costs were obtained from the Korea National Statistical Office, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. Inputs on the probabilities of clinical treatment pathways (e.g., tympanostomy) were derived from international literature if data specific to Korea did not exist. To estimate the benefits of universal immunization, the serotype-specific efficacy of {PCV}-7 was derived from studies conducted by Northern California Kaiser Permanente and by the Finnish Otitis Media Vaccine Study and applied to the serotypes isolated in Korean children with sp infections. The effects of vaccination on quality of life, herd immunity, benefits after the first 5 years of life, and patient copayments were not considered. A 4-dose schedule was used in the base-case analysis. A 3-dose schedule was also evaluated. The assumed price per dose was Korean won ({KW}) 70,000 (approximately {US}54; 2009 exchange rate {US}1 = {KW}1,300). Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. {RESULT}(S): Implementing a 4-dose universal {PCV}-7 vaccination strategy in a birth cohort of 451,514 infants in Korea would prevent 96,728 cases of pneumococcal-related infections (591 meningitis, 1,379 bacteremia, 43,950 pneumonia, and 50,808 otitis media cases) and 218 deaths (199 discounted deaths averted, 575 discounted {LYG} over 5 years). The medical and non-medical cost burden of pneumococcal diseases offset with vaccination was {KW}44.033 million ({US}33.87 million). The incremental discounted cost of universal vaccination was estimated to be {KW}86,384 million ({US}66.45 million). The incremental cost per {LYG} was {KW}150.2 million ({US}115,549) for the 4-dose schedule and {KW}103.91 million ({US}79,955) for the 3-dose schedule. The break-even costs were {KW}22,100 and {KW}28,100 per dose for the 4- and 3-dose schedules, respectively. {CONCLUSION}(S): Universal {PCV}-7 vaccination of infants in Korea could substantially reduce pneumococcal disease morbidity, mortality, and related costs by preventing pneumococcal infections. However, at current market prices for the vaccine, a universal vaccination strategy is not cost-effective. The literature suggests that factors not considered in this analysis, including vaccine price reduction and indirect effects on public health (e.g., herd immunity), have the potential to make the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of universal {PCV}-7 vaccination in Korea more favorable.

	abstract = {{IntroductionPneumonia} is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in children under 5 in Egypt, and the Ministry of Health of Egypt is considering introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) in its national immunization program. We performed an economic analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this vaccine in Egypt and to provide the decision-makers with needed evidence. {MethodsThe} analysis was done using the {TRIVAC} model. Data included demographic characteristics, burden of disease, coverage and efficacy of the vaccine, health resource utilization, and costs of pneumococcal disease vaccination and treatment. Whenever possible, we used national or regional data. Two alternatives were compared: (1) general vaccination of children younger than 5 years with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}13), using a three-dose schedule without booster, and (2) no vaccination. Outcomes of 10 cohorts from birth to 5 years were analyzed. The study was performed from the governmental perspective and selected public health providers. {ResultsIn} comparison to no vaccine, the introduction of {PCV}13 would be cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of {US} 3916 per disability-adjusted life-year ({DALY}) averted (government perspective). The total incremental cost of the {PCV} vaccination program (10 cohorts) would be approximately {US} 1.09 billion. Over the 10 cohorts, the program would avert 8583 pneumococcal deaths - 42\% of all pneumococcal-related deaths. {ConclusionThe} introduction of {PCV}13 would be a good value for money from the government perspective. It would represent a high-impact public health intervention for Egypt and respond to the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group ({NITAG}) resolution on reducing pneumonia burden and overall child mortality. Strengthening surveillance will be critical to generating high-quality national data, improving future economic analyses that support evidence-based decisions for introducing vaccines and public health interventions, and to monitoring their impact.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, the cost-effectiveness of this new {PCV}-13 for children {\textless}5 years in mainland China is not clear. Method(s): In the present study, we developed a Markov model under societal perspective to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ({ICERs}) of five birth cohorts of 100,000 Chinese infants across four alternative vaccination programs:1) no vaccination; 2) vaccinate 4 doses of new {PCV}-13 for children aged 2 to 6 months; 3) vaccinate 3 doses of new {PCV}-13 for children aged 7 to 11 months; 4) vaccinate 2 doses of new {PCV}-13 for children aged 12 to 23 months; 5) vaccinate 1 dose of new {PCV}-13 for children aged 2 to 5 years. We conducted one-way and probability sensitivity analysis to determine the uncertainty of the model findings. Result(s): We found that with awillingness-to-pay ({WTP}) threshold of three-times Chinese per-capita gross domestic product ({GDP}) all vaccination programs were cost-effective compared to no vaccination and children aged 2 to 5 years received 1 dose of new {PCV}-13 would incur the lowest additional cost of {US}2417 per quality-adjusted-life-years ({QALYs}) compare with other vaccination programs (15394/{QALYs} for 4 doses program, 9292/{QALYs} for 3 doses program, 4445/{QALYs} for 2 doses program).

In Korea, both 13-valent and 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are currently used for the prevention of pneumococcal infections for Pediatrics. This study aims to evaluate the long-term economic and clinical impact of {PCV}-13 versus {PCV}-10 vaccination in prevention of {IPD}, pneumonia and acute otitis media ({AOM}) from health care system perspective. Method(s): A Markov cohort model with a 10-year time horizon was used to estimate the effect of infant vaccination with {PCV}-13 versus {PCV}-10. Using this model, we considered disease incidence and serotype coverage and health care utilization to compare costs and clinical impact of {PCV}-13 versus {PCV}-10 on {IPD}, inpatient and outpatient pneumonia, and {AOM} , among vaccinated children (direct effect) and the entire population with indirect(herd effects). Patients were entered in the model by age groups: ages 0-{\textless} 2 years, 2-4 years, 5-17 years, 18-34 years, 35-49 years, 50-64 years, 65+ years. Only 0-2 year cohort was vaccinated. The local epidemiology and cost data were used to achieve national specificity. Direct/Indirect effectiveness of {PCV}- 13 and {PCV}-10 were calculated based on {PCV}-7 efficacy data, using assumptions regarding serotype coverage and {PCV}-10 and {PCV}-13 protection against additional serotypes. Result(s): In the analysis, {PCV}-13 vaccination has caused significant decline in all {PD} cases. It was estimated to prevent 19,918 cases of {IPD}, 3,796,657 cases of pneumonia, and 53,310,807 cases of {AOM} in 10-year cohort. Also the incremental cost per {LYG} was estimated at 10,043,048 won for the {PCV}-13 vaccination from the health care system perspective in the 10-year horizon, as compared to {PCV}-10 vaccination. Conclusion(s): {PCV}-13 vaccination program provided economic and clinical impact on overall {PD} prevention and cost-effective compared with {PCV}-10 vaccination.},

	abstract = {Background: The Colombian health authorities introduced the pneumococcal conjugated vaccine and the seasonal influenza vaccine into the national immunization schedule for children in 2009 and 2007, respectively. Despite this, the health authorities continue to be concerned about the high economic and disease burden among children from low-income households caused by these vaccine-preventable diseases. Objective(s): 1) To evaluate the potential health outcomes of four vaccination strategies for subsidized children younger than 5 years in a low-income district in Colombia from a public, direct medical health care perspective. 2) To perform univariate, multivariate, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of these results. Method(s): We built a Markov deterministic cohort model to evaluate five consecutive cohorts across four alternative situations: 1) no vaccination; 2) vaccination with the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}10 vaccine); 3) vaccination with the trivalent inactivated vaccine ({TIV}) annually; and 4) combined vaccination with {PCV}10 vaccine and {TIV}. Result(s): The introduction of {PCV}10 vaccine and {TIV} and their combined use in particular would be highly cost-effective in comparison to no vaccination. For the combined vaccination with {PCV}10 vaccine and {TIV}, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio would be 1,280 per disability-adjusted life-year ({DALY}) averted, the total incremental cost of the vaccination program would be 776,800, and it would avert four deaths and 332 {DALYs} for the five cohorts. Conclusion(s): The introduction of {PCV}10 vaccine and {TIV} would be highly cost-effective from a public, direct medical health care perspective. Despite these results, we have not observed decreases in severity or hospitalizations.

Objective(s): To assess the cost effectiveness of replacing {PCV}13 with pneumococcal nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine ({PHiD}-{CV}). Method(s): A Markov cohort model with monthly cycles following 1 cohort of infants over a 10-year time horizon was used. Local input parameters were obtained from published sources and expert consultation whenever possible. The model was adapted to estimate the health benefits and economic impact of each vaccine on invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media ({AOM}). An annual discount rate of 3\% was used for benefits and costs (2016 euros). Result(s): Under base-case assumptions, vaccinating 1 birth cohort of 1 325 783 infants with {PHiD}-{CV} instead of {PCV}13 was predicted to have the same impact on meningitis and pneumonia, a similar impact on bacteremia (+30 cases), but greater reductions in {AOM}-related general practitioner visits (-34 955) and hospitalizations (-624). Assuming equal vaccine prices, {PHiD}-{CV} was predicted to be dominant over {PCV}13 (176 additional quality-adjusted life-years while saving 635 330 [discounted]). One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that varying the vaccine price differential had the largest effect on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and then {AOM} parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted {PHiD}-{CV} to be dominant over {PCV}13 in 92.4\% of simulations. Conclusion(s): Any difference in price between {PHiD}-{CV} and {PCV}13 is expected to be the key driver of vaccine choice for preventing childhood pneumococcal disease in Turkey. At price parity, {PHiD}-{CV} use is likely to be a dominant strategy over the use of {PCV}13.Copyright © 2019 {ISPOR}-The professional society for health economics and outcomes research},

After {PCV} 7-valent ({PCV}7) withdrawal, {PCV} 10-valent ({PCV}10) and {PCV} 13-valent ({PCV}13) are the alternatives in Peru. This study aimed to evaluate cost effectiveness of these vaccines in preventing {PP} in Peruvian children {\textless}5 years-old., Methodology: A cost-effectiveness analysis was developed in three phases: a systematic evidence search for calculating effectiveness; a cost analysis for vaccine strategies and outcome management; and an economic model based on decision tree analysis, including deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using acceptability curves, tornado diagram, and Monte Carlo simulation. A hypothetic 100 vaccinated children/vaccine cohort was built. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ({ICER}) was calculated., Results: The isolation probability for all serotypes in each vaccine was estimated: 38\% for {PCV}7, 41\% {PCV}10, and 17\% {PCV}13. Avoided hospitalization was found to be the best effectiveness model measure. Estimated costs for {PCV}7, {PCV}10, and {PCV}13 cohorts were {USD}13,761, 11,895, and 12,499, respectively. Costs per avoided hospitalization were {USD}718 for {PCV}7, {USD}333 for {PCV}10, {andUSD} 162 for {PCV}13. At {ICER}, {PCV}7 was dominated by the other {PCVs}. Eliminating {PCV}7, {PCV}13 was more cost effective than {PCV}10 (confirmed in sensitivity analysis)., Conclusions: {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 are more cost effective than {PCV}7 in prevention of pneumonia in children {\textless}5 years-old in Peru. {PCV}13 prevents more hospitalizations and is more cost-effective than {PCV}10.

This study evaluates the potential economic benefits of introducing a public financed City Immunization Program ({CIP}) to pay for {PCV}7 from a payer perspective. {METHOD}(S): A decision-analytic model was populated with local direct cost and seroprevalence data from case records of 3 hospitals (1 Children's Hospital; 2 Comprehensive Hospitals) and literature to estimate the clinical and economic impact of no {PCV}7 vaccination, {PCV}7 Category {II} listing, and {PCV}7 {CIP} in the city of Shenzhen. Various sources of data were used to estimate the primary statistics including age-specific incidence/mortality of invasive pneumococcal disease ({IPD}), pneumonia and otitis media, local patient demographics, and {PCV}7 efficacy from clinical trial data. The indirect effect on unvaccinated populations was considered by estimating the reduction in adult {IPD} cases following {PCV}7 programs published overseas, and was only applied in the {CIP} scenario where broad vaccine coverage could be achieved. A discount rate of 5\% was applied, and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed as well. {RESULT}(S): Under the current setting, the Category {II} vaccine {PCV}7 is not cost-effective due to the private market unit price and low penetration rate. However, vaccination of 154,721 children under 2 years old from a public financed {CIP} in Shenzhen would prevent 18 {IPD}, 5887 hospitalized pneumonia, 20020 outpatient pneumonia, and 10669 otitis media cases if indirect effects are included, compared to no vaccination program. From a payer perspective, a {PCV}7 {CIP} would achieve an {ICER} of {RMB}61, 243 ({USD}9, 141) per {QALY} versus no vaccination, and dominant versus Category {II}. {CONCLUSION}(S): Results from this study indicate a {PCV}7 {CIP} would be a highly cost-effective intervention from a public payer's perspective.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: In 2010, there were more than 1500 illness related to Streptococcus pneumonia infections in pediatric population under 2 years old in Panama. Currently, in Panama, Prevenar 7 is the anti-pneumococcal vaccine ({PCV}) used. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of immunization strategies based on pneumococcal conjugated vaccines ({PCVs}) in Panama, from an institutional perspective. {METHOD}(S): A decision tree steady state model was used to assess the population level public health and economic impact of infant anti-pneumococcal vaccination. The alternatives compared were: no vaccination (comparator), {PCV}-7, {PCV}-10 and {PCV}-13. The effectiveness measures were: child illness avoided, life years gained ({LYs}) and quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs}) gained. Effectiveness and utilities were obtained from literature. Local costs (expressed in 2011 {US}) and epidemiology (data from 2009-2011) were obtained from Panama=s official databases. Univariate sensitivity analysis was performed. The time horizon for total costs was one year and for outcomes was lifetime with a discount rate of 3\%. {RESULT}(S): Results show that immunization is cost-saving against no-vaccination. {PCV}-13 gained the highest number of {QALYs} (305) against {PCV}-10 (191) and {PCV}-7 (168). {PCV}-13 prevented 629 illnesses and gained 334 {LYs}. {PCV}-10 and {PCV}-7 prevented 392 and 359 illnesses and gained 208 and 182 {LY}=s, respectively. Total costs of illness with {PCV}-13, {PCV}-10, {PCV}-7 and no vaccination were 622,445, 777,878, 804,978 and \$1,005,512, respectively. These results were robust to variations in herd immunity and impact adjustments of {PCV}-10 immunogenicity. {CONCLUSION}(S): This is the first cost-effectiveness study for antipneumococcal immunization in Panama. Immunization strategies based on 7, 10 and 13-valent {PCV}=s may be cost-saving interventions compared to no vaccination. {PCV}-13 dominates {PCV}-10 and {PCV}-7.},

Method(s): A Markov cohort model which simulates in a Bulgarian birth cohort the disease process of invasive disease ({ID}) (meningitis and bacteremia), community acquired pneumonia ({CAP}), and acute otitis media ({AOM}) over life-time caused by S. pneumoniae and non-typeable Haemophilus Influenzae ({NTHi}). The cohort model essentially considers the perspective of the health care payer. Bulgarian specific epidemiological and demographic data and data from other country sources were obtained for the model. Base case assumptions include estimates of pneumococcal and {NTHi} infection rates as well as vaccine efficacy based on published literature, 94\% vaccine coverage, herd protection and a (3+1) vaccination schedule. One-way sensitivity analyses performed to assess the impact of changes in key model assumptions. Result(s): {PHiD}-{CV} and {PCV}-13 are projected to prevent 29.4 and 29.9 cases of invasive diseases respectively and 437 and 434 bacteremia hospitalizations respectively . {PHiD}-{CV} in comparison with {PCV}-13 is projected to prevent additional 9393 cases of {AOM}, 426 myringotomies and 2801 {GP} visits. Vaccinating a birth cohort with {PHiD}-{CV} is expected to generate 41 more {QALYs} compared to {PCV}-13. The estimated total savings for health care system are 1.77 mil Euro. The {PHiD}-{CV} is dominant in comparison with {PCV}- 13. Sensitivity analyses indicate that {GP} visits for {AOM} and efficacy vs. {AOM} due to Streptococcus Pneumonia non-Vaccine Types Sp {nVT} have biggest impact on results. Conclusion(s): Overall, {PHiD}-{CV} is expected to have {betterI} impact and under the given assumptions, {PHiD}-{CV} dominates {PCV}-13 because it also has a larger cost offsets.},

	abstract = {Background: A recently developed 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable H influenzae protein D-conjugate vaccine ({PHiD}-{CV}) is expected to afford protection against more than two thirds of isolates causing {IPD} in children in Latin America, and also against acute otitis media caused by both Spn and {NTHi}. The objective of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of {PHiD}-{CV} in comparison to non-vaccination in children under 10 years of age in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Method(s): We used a static, deterministic, compartmental simulation model. The dosing regimen considered included three vaccine doses (at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months) and a booster dose (at 13 months) (3 + 1 schedule). Model outcomes included number of cases prevented, deaths averted, quality-adjusted life-years ({QALYs}) gained and costs. Discount for costs and benefits of long term sequelae was done at 3.5\%, and currency reported in 2008-2009 {US} varying between countries. Result(s): The largest effect in case prevention was observed in pneumococcal meningitis (from 27\% in Peru to 47\% in Colombia), neurologic sequelae after meningitis (from 38\% in Peru to 65\% in Brazil) and bacteremia (from 42\% in Argentina to 49\% in Colombia). The proportion of predicted deaths averted annually ranged from 18\% in Peru to 33\% in Brazil. Overall, the health benefits achieved with {PHiD}-{CV} vaccination resulted in a lower {QALY} loss (from 15\% lower in Peru to 26\% in Brazil). At a cost of {USD} 20 per vaccine dose, vaccination was cost-effective in all countries, from being cost saving in Chile to a maximum Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio of 7,088 {US} Dollars per {QALY} gained. Results were robust in the sensitivity analysis, and scenarios with indirect costs affected results more than those with herd immunity. Conclusion(s): The incorporation of the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine into routine infant immunization programs in Latin American countries could be a cost-effective strategy to improve infant population health in the region. © 2013 Marti et al.; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background Although China has a high burden of pneumococcal disease among young children, the government does not administer publicly-funded pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ({PCV}) through its Expanded Program on Immunization ({EPI}). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of publicly-funded {PCV}-7, {PCV}-10, and {PCV}-13 vaccination programs for infants in China. Methods Using a Markov model, we simulated a cohort of 16 million Chinese infants to estimate the impact of {PCV}-7, {PCV}-10, and {PCV}-13 vaccination programs from a societal perspective. We extrapolated health states to estimate the effects of the programs over the course of a lifetime of 75 years. Parameters in the model were derived from a review of the literature. Results We found that {PCV}-7, {PCV}-10, and {PCV}-13 vaccination programs would be cost-effective compared to no vaccination. However, {PCV}-13 had the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (11,464/{QALY} vs 16,664/{QALY} for {PCV}-10 and \$18,224/{QALY} for {PCV}-7) due to a reduction in overall costs. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were most sensitive to the utility of acute otitis media, the cost of {PCV}-13, and the incidence of pneumonia and acute otitis media. Conclusions The Chinese government should take steps to reduce the burden of pneumococcal diseases among young children through the inclusion of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in its {EPI}. Although all vaccinations would be cost-effective, {PCV}-13 would save more costs to the healthcare system and would be the preferred strategy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Method(s): The integrated {TRIVAC} vaccine cost-effectiveness model from the Pan American Health Organization's {ProVac} Initiative (version 2.0) was applied from the perspective of the Government of Peru. Twenty successive cohorts of children from birth to 5 years were evaluated. Clinical outcomes were pneumococcal pneumonia ({PP}), pneumococcal meningitis ({PM}), pneumococcal sepsis ({PS}) and acute otitis media from any causes ({AOM}). Measures included prevention of cases, neurological sequelae ({NS}), auditory sequelae ({AS}), deaths and disability adjusted life years ({DALYs}). A sensitivity analyses was also performed. Finding(s): For the 20 cohorts, net costs with {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 were {US} 363.26 million and {US} 408.26 million, respectively. {PCV}10 prevented 570,273 {AOM}; 79,937 {PP}; 2217 {PM}; 3049 {PS}; 282 {NS}; 173 {AS}; and 7512 deaths. {PCV}13 prevented 419,815 {AOM}; 112,331 {PN}; 3116 {PM}; 4285 {PS}; 404 {NS}; 248 {AS}; and 10,386 deaths.

Costs per {DALY} averted were {US} 1605 for {PCV}10, and {US} 1304 for {PCV}13. Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. {PCV}13 has an extended dominance over {PCV}10. Conclusion(s): Both pneumococcal vaccines are cost effective in the Peruvian context. Although the net cost of vaccination with {PCV}10 is lower, {PCV}13 prevented more deaths, pneumococcal complications and sequelae. Costs per each prevented {DALY} were lower with {PCV}13. Thus, {PCV}13 would be the preferred policy; {PCV}10 would also be reasonable (and cost-saving relative to the status quo) if for some reason 13-valent were not feasible.Copyright © 2015 .},

	abstract = {Background: In 2009, Gavi, the World Bank, and donors launched the pneumococcal Advance Market Commitment, which helped countries access more affordable pneumococcal vaccines. As many low-income countries begin to reach the threshold at which countries transition from Gavi support to self-financing (3-year average gross national income per capita of {US}1580), they will need to consider whether to continue pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) use at full cost or to discontinue {PCV} in their childhood immunisation programmes. Using Kenya as a case study, we assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness of continuing {PCV} use. Method(s): In this modelling and cost-effectiveness study, we fitted a dynamic compartmental model of pneumococcal carriage to annual carriage prevalence surveys and invasive pneumococcal disease ({IPD}) incidence in Kilifi, Kenya. We predicted disease incidence and related mortality for either continuing {PCV} use beyond 2022, the start of Kenya's transition from Gavi support, or its discontinuation. We calculated the costs per disability-adjusted life-year ({DALY}) averted and associated 95\% prediction intervals ({PI}). Finding(s): We predicted that if {PCV} use is discontinued in Kenya in 2022, overall {IPD} incidence will increase from 8.5 per 100 000 in 2022, to 16.2 per 100 000 per year in 2032. Continuing vaccination would prevent 14 329 (95\% {PI} 6130-25 256) deaths and 101 513 (4386-196 674) disease cases during that time. Continuing {PCV} after 2022 will require an estimated additional {US}15.8 million annually compared with discontinuing vaccination. We predicted that the incremental cost per {DALY} averted of continuing {PCV} would be 153 (95\% {PI} 70-411) in 2032. Interpretation(s): Continuing {PCV} use is essential to sustain its health gains. Based on the Kenyan {GDP} per capita of 1445, and in comparison to other vaccines, continued {PCV} use at full costs is cost-effective (on the basis of the assumption that any reduction in disease will translate to a reduction in mortality). Although affordability is likely to be a concern, our findings support an expansion of the vaccine budget in Kenya.

In Colombia there are two pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ({PCV}) that have proved clinical efficacy. The aim was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 13-valent {PCV} ({PCV}13) and 10-valent {PCV} ({PCV}10) in terms of prevention of Invasive Pneumococcal Diseases ({IPD}), radiologically-confirmed pneumonia, and their related mortality, as well as, acute otitis media ({AOM}) in a cohort of newborns in Colombia. Method(s): We developed an analytical decision tree model with national data including the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes in Colombia between 2009 and 2013. A simulation of vaccination of 90\% of newborns in Colombia took place with a time horizon of 5 years. The analysis was done from the Colombian health system perspective. Vaccines efficacy parameters were measured as life-years gained ({LYG}) and avoided morbidity by pneumococcal diseases; they were determined by a systematic review of literature. A health insurance company provided the costs. A probabilistic and a univariate sensitivity analysis for epidemiological, efficacy and cost parameters were done. Result(s): After 5 years projection, {PCV}13 would prevent 437 deaths due to pneumococcal infections versus 321 that would be prevented by {PCV}10, compared to no vaccination. {PCV}13 would generate 25 396 {LYG}, and {PCV}10 would generate 18 708 {LYG}. Medical costs avoided would be {US} 19 479 395 for {PCV}13 and {US} 13 703 271 for {PCV}10. Compared to no vaccination, {PCV}13 and {PCV}10 were cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ({ICER}) of {US} 489.26 and {US} 813.41 per additional {LYG}, respectively; besides, {PCV}13 was dominant over {PCV}10 due to lower costs and better outcomes. Conclusion(s): {PCV}13 is a cost-saving strategy compared with {PCV}10, as part of a universal coverage vaccination program in Colombian children under one year. {PCV}13 is expected to lead to a greater decrement in infant mortality from pneumococcal diseases, and a higher cost saving by preventing more pneumococcal diseases compared with {PCV}10 in a 5 years projection.Copyright © 2015 Ordonez and Orozco; licensee {BioMed} Central.},

Uptake has been slow in particular regions, with coverage only reaching all regions in 2019. Given affordability challenges in the context of higher coverage, this study seeks to determine whether universal coverage across all regions of the Philippines with {PCV}13-{PFE} will provide good value for money compared with 10-valent {PCV} alternatives manufactured by {GlaxoSmithKline} ({PCV}10-{GSK}) or Serum Institute of India ({PCV}10-{SII}). Method(s): A decision analytic model is adapted for this cost-effectiveness analysis in the Philippines. Clinical and economic input parameters are taken from published sources. Future disease is predicted using age-stratified and population-level observed serotype dynamics. Total cases of pneumococcal disease, deaths, direct and indirect healthcare costs, and quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs}) gained are discounted 7\% annually and modeled for each {PCV}. Given clinical uncertainty, {PCV}10-{SII} outcomes are reported as ranges. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ({ICERs}) are calculated for {PCV}13-{PFE} versus lower-valent {PCVs} ({PCV}10-{GSK} or {PCV}10-{SII}) from a societal perspective over 10 years. Result(s): Nationwide {PCV}13-{PFE} use over 10 years is estimated to avert 375,831 more cases, save 53,189 additional lives, and gain 153,349 {QALYs} compared with {PCV}10-{GSK}. This equates to cost-savings of {PHP} 12.27 billion after vaccine costs are accounted for. Similarly, {PCV}13-{PFE} is more effective and cost-saving compared with {PCV}10-{SII}. Switching programs to {PCV}10-{SII} would result in more cases of disease (313,797 - 666,889), more deaths (22,759 - 72,435), and lost {QALYs} (108,061 - 266,108), equating to a net economic loss ({PHP} 359.82 million - 14.41 billion). {PCV}13-{PFE} remains cost-effective in the presence of parameter uncertainty. Conclusion(s): {PCV}13-{PFE} would prevent exceedingly more cases and deaths compared with lower-valent {PCVs}. Additionally, the {PCV}13-{PFE} program is estimated to continue providing cost-savings, offering the best value for money to achieve universal {PCV} coverage in the Philippines.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: Widespread use of ten-valent ({SynflorixTM}, {GSK}) or 13-valent (Prevenar 13TM; Pfizer) conjugate vaccination programs has effectively reduced invasive pneumococcal disease ({IPD}) globally. However, {IPD} caused by serotypes not contained within the respective vaccines continues to increase, notably serotypes 3, 6A, and 19A in countries using lower-valent vaccines. Our objective was to estimate the clinical and economic benefit of replacing {PCV}10 with {PCV}13 in Colombia, Finland, and The Netherlands. Method(s): Country-specific databases, supplemented with published and unpublished data, informed the historical incidence of pneumococcal disease as well as direct and indirect medical costs. A decision-analytic forecasting model was applied, and both costs and outcomes were discounted. The observed invasive pneumococcal disease ({IPD}) trends from each country were used to forecast the future number of {IPD} cases given a {PCV}13 or {PCV}10 program. Result(s): Over a 5-year time horizon, a switch to a {PCV}13 program was estimated to reduce overall {IPD} among 0-2 year olds by an incremental - 37.6\% in Colombia, - 32.9\% in Finland, and - 26\% in The Netherlands, respectively, over {PCV}10. Adults {\textgreater} 65 years experienced a comparable incremental decrease in overall {IPD} in Colombia (- 32.2\%), Finland (- 15\%), and The Netherlands (- 3.7\%). Serotypes 3, 6A, and 19A drove the incremental decrease in disease for {PCV}13 over {PCV}10 in both age groups. A {PCV}13 program was dominant in Colombia and Finland and cost-effective in The Netherlands at 1 x {GDP} per capita (34,054/{QALY}). Conclusion(s): In Colombia, Finland, and The Netherlands, countries with diverse epidemiologic and population distributions, switching from a {PCV}10 to {PCV}13 program would significantly reduce the burden of {IPD} in all three countries in as few as 5 years.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Routine vaccination of infants against Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) needs substantial investment by governments and charitable organisations. Policymakers need information about the projected health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of vaccination when considering these investments. Our aim was to incorporate these data into an economic analysis of pneumococcal vaccination of infants in countries eligible for financial support from the Global Alliance for Vaccines \& Immunization ({GAVI}). Method(s): We constructed a decision analysis model to compare pneumococcal vaccination of infants aged 6, 10, and 14 weeks with no vaccination in the 72 countries that were eligible as of 2005. We used published and unpublished data to estimate child mortality, effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and immunisation rates. Finding(s): Pneumococcal vaccination at the rate of diptheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine coverage was projected to prevent 262 000 deaths per year (7\%) in children aged 3-29 months in the 72 developing countries studied, thus averting 8.34 million disability-adjusted life years ({DALYs}) yearly. If every child could be reached, up to 407 000 deaths per year would be prevented. At a vaccine cost of International 5 per dose, vaccination would have a net cost of 838 million, a cost of 100 per {DALY} averted. Vaccination at this price was projected to be highly cost-effective in 68 of 72 countries when each country's per head gross domestic product per {DALY} averted was used as a benchmark. Interpretation(s): At a vaccine cost of between 1 and \$5 per dose, purchase and accelerated uptake of pneumococcal vaccine in the world's poorest countries is projected to substantially reduce childhood mortality and to be highly cost-effective. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Objective The Ministry of Health ({MOH}), Mongolia, is considering introducing 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}13) in its national immunization programme to prevent the burden of disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of introducing {PCV}13 compared to no {PCV} vaccination in Mongolia. Methods The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ({ICER}) of introducing {PCV}13 compared to no {PCV} vaccination was assessed using an age-stratified static multiple cohort model. The risk of various clinical presentations of pneumococcal disease (meningitis, pneumonia, non-meningitis non-pneumonia invasive pneumococcal disease and acute otitis media) at all ages for thirty birth cohorts was assessed. The analysis considered both health system and societal perspectives. A 3 + 0 vaccine schedule and price of {US}3.30 per dose was assumed for the baseline scenario based on Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance's advance market commitment tail price. Results The {ICER} of {PCV}13 introduction is estimated at {US}52 per disability-adjusted life year ({DALY}) averted (health system perspective), and cost-saving (societal perspective). Although indirect effects of {PCV} have been well-documented, a conservative scenario that does not consider indirect effects estimated {PCV}13 introduction to cost {US}79 per {DALY} averted (health system perspective), and {US}19 per {DALY} averted (societal perspective). Vaccination with {PCV}13 is expected to cost around {US}920,000 in 2016, and thereafter {US}820,000 every year. The programme is likely to reduce direct disease-related costs to {MOH} by {US}440,000 in the first year, increasing to {US}510,000 by 2025. Conclusion Introducing {PCV}13 as part of Mongolia's national programme appears to be highly cost-effective when compared to no vaccination and cost-saving from a societal perspective at vaccine purchase prices offered through Gavi. Notwithstanding uncertainties around some parameters, cost-effectiveness of {PCV} introduction for Mongolia remains robust over a range of conservative scenarios. Availability of high-quality national data would improve future economic analyses for vaccine introduction.Copyright © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {Policy-makers increasingly rely on cost-effectiveness analysis, in addition to clinical effectiveness, when considering the introduction of new childhood vaccines. A previous analysis determined vaccination of infants with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) to be highly cost effective in preventing child mortality in countries eligible for financial support from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization ({GAVI}). We aimed to update this analysis by incorporating recent data on global disease burden, indirect effects and higher valency vaccines. Decision analytic models were built using an incidence-based approach in order to evaluate a three-dose vaccination schedule of infants in 72 {GAVI}-eligible countries over a 10-year programme. Seven-, 10- and 13-valent vaccine formulations were each compared with no vaccination. Depending on the formulation used, {PCV} could avert 294 000-603 000 deaths and 9.3-17.6 million disability-adjusted life-years ({DALY}) annually. The majority (91\%) of the {DALYs} averted would be through the vaccine's direct effects in children under-5. Using {WHO} thresholds and a negotiated average dose cost, {PCV} would be highly cost effective in 69 of 72 {GAVI}-eligible countries. This finding was robust when assumptions regarding disease epidemiology and vaccine-related effects were varied in sensitivity analyses. The current analysis supports {PCV} introduction in {GAVI}-eligible countries owing to its potential to avert substantial numbers of deaths at relatively low incremental costs.

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of the use of nine-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine in a routine infant immunisation programme based on the Pneumococcal Vaccine Trial ({PVT}) study in The Gambia. Method(s): This was a clinical trial-based cost-effectiveness study conducted as part of the {PVT} study. The {PVT} was an intention-to-treat double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a nine-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine. The trial was conducted in the eastern parts of The Gambia, West Africa and recruited 17437 children aged 40-364 days. A deterministic static cohort model was developed to evaluate direct benefits and costs of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in The Gambia's routine immunisation programme. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ({iCER}) is defined as vaccinating infants against pneumococcal disease compared with no vaccination from a public provider's perspective using The Gambia's 2005 projected under-one-year population. Key Findings: The results show the use of the vaccine in The Gambia's routine infant vaccination programme to be cost effective using an assumed price of {US}5.00 per vial in single-dose vials. Compared with offering no vaccination, the incremental cost per {DALYs} averted would be 30 {DALYs} from the public provider perspective. At least 1569 and 340 invasive childhood pneumococcal illnesses and deaths respectively among the cohort would be prevented. In the absence of the vaccine 16871 {DALYs} would be lost while with the use of the vaccine 7804 {DALYs} would be lost. Given the average treatment cost of pneumococcal illnesses to be {US}191 (95\% confidence interval 180 to 203) the introduction of the vaccine programme would lead to an additional cost of {US}274279 (about {US}8.43/child). Conclusion(s): The availability of a cost-effective vaccine that can prevent thousands of pneumococcal illnesses and related deaths is a major development towards improving the disease burden in sub-Saharan African countries. This study supports the introduction of nine-valent pneumococcal vaccine into the infant immunisation programme of The Gambia as it is cost effective and will avert many preventable deaths and illnesses. Despite differences in distribution of serotypes between countries, the static model used in the analysis makes the results applicable to other developing countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2011 The Authors. {JPHSR} © 2011 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.},

The Turkish government introduced 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) into the national immunization program in 2009. This suggests that replacing 7-valent {PCV} with a higher-valent version could at least maintain "standard of care" if not improve it, and that it could be affordable. Objectives and Methods The aim of this analysis was to assess the potential direct cost-effectiveness of 13-valent {PCV} in Turkey, a country with a birth cohort of 1.4 million, against a "no vaccine" state, against the default 7-valent {PCV} state, and against a 10-valent {PCV} state, using a published cohort model with a 5-year horizon. Results and Conclusions The cost per life-year gained is below the 1 x per-capita gross domestic product threshold across large changes in key input parameters, indicating that the model is stable and suggesting that any {PCV} would be very cost-effective in a Turkish national pediatric immunization schedule. © 2013 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research ({ISPOR}).},

	abstract = {Objective: Since the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}-10) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}-13) were recently licensed for use in Argentina, both vaccines were evaluated to estimate the costs, health benefits and cost-effectiveness of adding a {PCV} to the routine child immunization schedule. Methodology: The integrated {TRIVAC} vaccine cost-effectiveness model from Pan American Health Organization's {ProVac} Initiative (Version 1.0.65) was used to assess the health outcomes of 20 successive cohorts from birth to 5 years of age. {PCV}-10 and {PCV}-13 were each compared to a scenario assuming no {PCV} vaccination. A 3 + 1 (three doses + booster) schedule and a vaccination price of {US} 20.75 per dose was assumed in the base case for both vaccines. Result(s): Introduction of {PCV}-13 rather than {PCV}-10 would increase the number of life years gained ({LYG}) by at least 10\%. The number of {LYG} (and {LYG} after adjustment for {DALY} morbidity weights) was 56,882 (64,252) for {PCV}-10 compared to 65,038 (71,628) for {PCV}-13. From the health system perspective, the cost per {DALY} averted was {US} 8973 and {US} 10,948 for {PCV}-10 and {PCV}-13 respectively, and {US} 8546 and {US} 10,510 respectively, after incorporating costs saved by households. When {PCV}13 was compared to {PCV}10 directly, the additional benefits of {PCV}-13 was conferred at a cost of {US} 28,147 per {DALY} averted. Cost-effectiveness was influenced mainly by vaccine price, serotype replacement, pneumonia mortality and discount rate. Conclusion(s): Routine vaccination against S. pneumoniae in Argentina would be cost-effective with either {PCV}-10 or {PCV}-13. {PCV}-13, with higher coverage of local serotypes, would prevent more cases of pneumonia, invasive pneumococcal disease, sequelae and deaths with a higher number of {LYG} and {DALYs} averted, but {PCV}-10, due its higher impact in the prevention of {AOM}, would save more costs to the healthcare system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a universal mass vaccination program with a {PHiD}-{CV} 2+1 schedule versus no vaccination or with a {PCV}13 2+1 schedule in Malaysia. Method(s): A published Markov cohort model was adapted to evaluate the epidemiological and economic consequences of programs with no vaccination, a {PHiD}-{CV} 2+1 schedule or a {PCV}13 2+1 schedule over a 10-year time horizon. Disease cases, deaths, direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years ({QALYs}) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ({ICERs}) were estimated. Locally published epidemiology and cost data were used whenever possible. Vaccine effectiveness and disutility data were based on the best available published data. All data inputs and assumptions were validated by local clinical and health economics experts. Analyses were conducted from the perspective of the Malaysian government for a birth cohort of 508,774. Costs and {QALYs} were discounted at 3\% per annum. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Result(s): Compared with no vaccination, a {PHiD}-{CV} 2+1 program was projected to prevent 1109 invasive pneumococcal disease ({IPD}), 24,679 pneumonia and 72,940 acute otitis media ({AOM}) cases and 103 {IPD}/pneumonia deaths over 10years, with additional costs and {QALYs} of United States dollars ({USD}) 30.9 million and 1084 {QALYs}, respectively, at an {ICER} of {USD} 28,497/{QALY}. Compared with a {PCV}13 2+1 program, {PHiD}-{CV} 2+1 was projected to result in similar reductions in {IPD} cases (40 cases more) but significantly fewer {AOM} cases (30,001 cases less), with cost savings and additional {QALYs} gained of {USD} 5.2 million and 116 {QALYs}, respectively, demonstrating dominance over {PCV}13. Results were robust to variations in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusion(s): A {PHiD}-{CV} 2+1 universal mass vaccination program could substantially reduce pneumococcal disease burden versus no vaccination, and was expected to be cost-effective in Malaysia. A {PHiD}-{CV} 2+1 program was also expected to be a dominant choice over a {PCV}13 2+1 program in Malaysia.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).},

Both the 10-valent pneumococcal {NTHi} protein D conjugate vaccine ({PHiD}-{CV}) and the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}-13) are included in the National Immunization Program for infants in Korea. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 3+1 schedule of {PHiD}-{CV} versus that of {PCV}-13 for National Immunization Program in Korea. Method(s): A published Markov model was adapted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating the 2012 birth cohort with {PHiD}-{CV} vs. {PCV}-13 from the Korean government perspective over 10 y. Best available published data were used for epidemiology, vaccine efficacy and disutilities. Data on incidence and direct medical costs were taken from the national insurance claims database. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the robustness of the results. Result(s): {PHiD}-{CV} was projected to prevent an additional 195,262 cases of pneumococcal diseases and {NTHi}-related diseases vs. {PCV}-13, with a substantially greater reduction in {NTHi}-related {AOM} and a comparable reduction in {IPD} and community-acquired pneumonia. Parity-priced {PHiD}-{CV} generated a health gain of about 844 quality-adjusted life years and a total cost-saving of approximately 4 million United States Dollars ({USD}) over 10 y. 93\% of probabilistic simulations found {PHiD}-{CV} 3+1 to be the dominant vaccine option.

In comparison with the {PCV}13 2 + 1 strategy, the {PHiD}-{CV} 2 + 1 strategy was estimated to have a substantial reduction in acute otitis media (127,680 cases) and therefore a cost saving of potential 92.5 million pesos assuming price parity between {PHiD}-{CV} and {PCV}13 ({US} \$1 = 42.13 pesos in 2012). Conclusion(s): The {PHiD}-{CV} 2 + 1 {UMV} program is projected to be cost-effective, compared with no vaccination, and would provide substantial savings with higher quality-adjusted life-year gains as compared with the {PCV}13 2 + 1 strategy in the context of the Philippines. © 2014 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research ({ISPOR}).},

	abstract = {Background: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}-13) compared to a no vaccination strategy in Chinese infants. Method(s): A Markov process model was developed to examine the outcomes of {PCV}-13 against a no vaccination strategy using data and assumptions adapted for relevance to China. Outcomes over a lifetime horizon are presented. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the uncertainty. Result(s): Compared to no vaccination, a {PCV}-13 vaccination program would provide a gain of 0.009 additional quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs}) per subject. From the health care and societal perspectives, the incremental costs per {QALY} were 20,709 and 18,483, respectively. When herd effect was included, the cost effectiveness of the {PCV}-13 vaccination strategy was notably improved. The lower price of {PCV}-13 will improve the cost-effectiveness. Conclusion(s): The {PCV}-13 vaccination is likely to be cost-effective at the current Chinese prices and ceiling threshold (8,382).Copyright © 2018, © 2018 Taylor \& Francis.},

We evaluated the clinical and economic benefits of such programs with either 10- or 13-valent {PCVs} in Malaysia and Hong Kong by using an age-stratified Markov cohort model with many country-specific inputs. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ({QALY}) was calculated to compare {PCV}10 or {PCV}13 against no vaccination and {PCV}13 against {PCV}10 over a 10-year birth cohort's vaccination. Both payer and societal perspectives were used. {PCV}13 had better public health and economic outcomes than a {PCV}10 program across all scenarios considered. For example, in the base case scenario in Malaysia, {PCV}13 would reduce more cases of {IPD} (+2,296), pneumonia (+705,281), and acute otitis media (+376,967) and save more lives (+6,122) than {PCV}10. Similarly, in Hong Kong, {PCV}13 would reduce more cases of {IPD} cases (+529), pneumonia (+172,185), and acute otitis media (+37,727) and save more lives (+2,688) than {PCV}10. During the same time horizon, {PCV}13 would gain over 74,000 and 21,600 additional {QALYs} than {PCV}10 in Malaysia and Hong Kong, respectively. {PCV}13 would be cost saving when compared against similar program with {PCV}10, under both payer and societal perspective in both countries. {PCV}13 remained a better choice over {PCV}10 in multiple sensitivity, scenario, and probabilistic analyses. {PCV}13s broader serotype coverage in its formulation and herd effect compared against {PCV}10 were important drivers of differences in outcomes.Copyright © 2016 Taylor \& Francis Group, {LLC}.},

Over 10 years, pneumococcal vaccination would prevent at least 11.0 million cases and 314 000 deaths in children under-5, one-third of the pneumonia and invasive disease cases and deaths that would occur in this age group without vaccination. Herd protection would prevent 3.1 million cases and 163 000 deaths in older children and adults. A total of 11.1 million discounted disability-adjusted life-years ({DALY}) would be averted. At a dose cost of 10 for lower- middle-income and 20 for upper-middle-income countries, the net pooled (for all countries together) discounted vaccination cost would be 18.1 billion (1600 per {DALY} averted). Vaccination would be cost effective for 72 countries with the 7-valent vaccine and for all countries with the 10- or 13-valent vaccines.

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} Pneumococcal disease is a potentially fatal bacterial infection that is vaccine-preventable. Malaysia has yet to adopt a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) into its national immunization program ({NIP}). In 2016, pneumonia was the 3rd leading cause of death in children under five in Malaysia, accounting for 3.8\% of under-five deaths. Introducing a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) is an effective strategy to reduce the disease burden. This study used a decision-analytic model to assess the potential impacts of introducing the available {PCVs} (13-valent and 10-valent) in Malaysia. Epidemiological and costs inputs were sourced from published literature. For each vaccination program, health outcomes and associated healthcare costs were estimated. The scenarios of initiating {PCV}13 vs. {PCV}10 and the status quo (no pneumococcal vaccine) were compared. Serotype trends of Finland and the U.K. were used to model the clinical impacts of {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 respectively. The base-case analysis used a societal perspective over a 5-year time horizon. Compared with {PCV}10, {PCV}13 was projected to avert an additional 190,628 cases of pneumococcal disease and 1126 cases of death. The acquisition of {PCV}13 was estimated to cost an incremental {US}89,904,777, offset by a cost reduction of -{US}250,219,914 on pneumococcal disease-related medical care and lost productivity. {PCV}13 demonstrated a higher cost-saving potential over {PCV}10. Compared with no vaccination, {PCV}13 was estimated as cost-saving. Results were robust across a series of sensitivity analyses. The introduction of {PCV}13 in a {NIP} was estimated to reduce a significant burden of disease and to be a cost-saving for the Malaysian health system.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACTIntroduction}: Pneumococcal diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae represent a significant health and economic burden. Mexico has benefited from the inclusion of the 7-valent ({PCV}7) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ({PCV}13) since their inclusion in the National Immunization Program ({NIP}) in 2006 and 2010, respectively. The objective of this study is to estimate the impact of the existing program and predict future implications of a change in the current program.Methods: A previously published model was updated to estimate the historic impact of the {PCV} programs relative to pre-{PCV} implementation. Future disease trends were forecasted based on historical serotype behaviors for each {PCV}13 serotype and non-vaccine serotypes across different age groups. Costs and outcomes were estimated over a 10-year period based on continued use of {PCV}13 compared to a switch to {PCV}10.Results: The {PCV}7 and subsequent {PCV}13 {NIP} were estimated to prevent over 1.5 million cases of pneumococcal disease and 1,854 deaths, corresponding to a net savings of 34.50 Billion {MXN}. Continued use of {PCV}13 was estimated to save over 300 thousand cases of pneumococcal disease and 373 deaths compared to switching to {PCV}10 over a 10-year period. Despite a higher vaccine cost, maintaining {PCV}13 was cost-saving compared to {PCV}10, saving 6.71 billion {MXN} over 10 years.Conclusion: The {PCV} program in Mexico has provided a significant return on investment. Sustained {PCV}13 use was estimated to provide the greatest healthcare and economic impact in Mexico. Changes to the pneumococcal vaccination program could result in serotype replacement and reduction in herd effects.},
